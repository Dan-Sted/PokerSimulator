About the Authors
Lou Krieger learned poker at the tender age of 7, while standing at his
father’s side during the weekly Thursday night game held at the Krieger
kitchen table in the blue-collar Brooklyn neighborhood where they lived.
Lou played throughout high school and college and managed to keep his
head above water only because the other players were so appallingly bad.
But it wasn’t until his first visit to Las Vegas that he took poker seriously,
buying into a low-limit Seven Card Stud game where he managed — with a
good deal of luck — to break even.
“While playing stud,” he recalls, “1 noticed another game that looked evert
more interesting. It was Texas Hold’em.
“1 watched the Hold’em game for about 30 minutes, and sat down to play. One
hour and $100 later, 1 was hooked. I didn’t mind losing. It was the first time I
played, and 1 expected to lose. But I didn’t like feeling like a dummy so I
bought and studied every poker book I could find.”
“I studied; I played. 1 studied and played more. Before long I was winning reg-
ularly, and 1 haven’t had a losing year since 1 began keeping records.”
In the early 1990s Lou Krieger began writing a column called “On Strategy”
for Card Player Magazine. He has also written two books about poker,
Hold’em Excellence: From Beginner to Winner and MORE Hold’em Excellence:
A Winner For Life.
When not writing about poker, Lou (who lives in Long Beach, California) can
be found playing poker in the card casinos of Southern California.
Richard Harroch is an attorney with over 20 years of experience in repre-
senting start-up and emerging companies, entrepreneurs, and venture
capitalists. He is listed in “Who’s Who in American Law” and is a corporate
partner in a major law firm in San Francisco, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe
LLP. He is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of U.C. Berkeley and graduated from
UCLA Law School, where he was managing editor of the Law Review.He has
written a number of legal/business books, including The Small Business Kit
For Dummies; Start-Up and Emerging Companies: Planning, Financing and
Operating the Successful Business; and Partnership and Joint Venture
Agreements. He also spearheaded the development of a premier legal-agree-
ments Web site on the Internet.
He has lectured extensively before various legal and business organizations,
including the American Electronics Association, the Venture Capital Institute,
the California Continuing Education of the Bar, the Corporate Counsel
Institute, the San Francisco Bar, and the Practicing Law Institute (PLI).
Richard has served as the Chairman of the California State Bar Committee on
Partnerships, the Co-Chairman of the Corporations Committee of the San
Francisco Bar (Barristers), a member of the Executive Committee of the
Business Law Section of the California State Bar, and Co-Chair of the Law

Authors' Acknowledgments
Books are always a collaborative effort. Never believe an author who tells
you otherwise. Without the efforts of acquisitions editor Mark Butler, who
believed in and nurtured this project for two years, this book would not have
come to fruition.
Skilled editors are a wondrous breed, and the effort, assistance, and sugges-
tions of senior project editor Tim Gallan, and copy editor Patricia Yuu Pan
shaped this book into something we’re proud of. With dedication and talent,
Tim and Patricia possessed the magic to make the authors appear more liter-
ate, wittier, and eminently more readable than they really are.
We are also indebted to those who contributed their writing talent and poker
know-how to this book: to poker’s “Mad Genius” Mike Caro for his work on
“tells” — the body language of poker — and for many of the statistical tables
and tips found throughout this book; to Nolan Dalla for his biographical
sketches of poker legends past and present; to Dan Paymar for his informa-
tion on video poker; to Kathy Watterson for her chapter on Internet poker
and for showing you, the reader, how to use your personal computer to
improve your poker skills; and to Linda Johnson for her foreword.
The world of poker is far too large to individually thank each person we’d like
to acknowledge here: the dealers, players, floormen, chip runners, food
servers, board attendants, porters, cashiers, supervisors and managers,
props, players, and railbirds, who have all graciously enhanced our experi-
ences at the poker table. Here’s a warm and heartfelt thank you. And thanks
to friends and family members who have always encouraged our endeavors
— even those involving a risk and a gamble.
Special thanks to the folks at Card Player Magazine, who collectively possess
a bottomless reserve of poker knowledge, wisdom, and advice and are always
willing to share.
Dedication
From Lou: 1 dedicate this book to Abby, David, and Karen, and to all the
Lubchansky cousins whose grandparents sailed to America in steerage with
not much more than a suitcase and immigrant dreams. Their dream afforded
me the enviable luxury of living well by writing books and playing poker.
From Richard: I dedicate this book to the partners at my law firm who have
played poker with me for many years. Thanks for your money, guys!

MM lthough I had experience playing poker online and in poker rooms and
¥ " casinos, I hadn’t yet taken the time to really study the game of poker.
Becoming a student of poker means more than putting in a lyt of hours play-
ing (which I did). It also means putting in time really studying— and that’s
where Poker For Dummies comes in.
When poker really started to boom, bookstores saw a flood of poker books.
There are some good ones out there, and some truly bad ones. But even the
good ones don’t give you a broad enough picture of poker to allow you to
quickly discover the most popular games, and the vast majority of poker
books make one poor assumption — that you already know poker.
Most people have played some poker somewhere along the line, but how
many have sat in a casino or poker room and really played the game for
money? Reading Poker For Dummies can give you a good understanding of
poker and how it’s played everywhere— at home, in local poker rooms, and
in the huge casinos and poker rooms in Nevada, Atlantic City, California, and
elsewhere.
You can play poker in many different forms; it’s a lot different than it was 30
or 40 years ago, when draw poker was the name of the game. These days, you
find seven card stud, seven card stud high/low, Texas Hold’em, and Omaha
and Omaha high/low in most poker rooms, played at all different stakes.
Poker For Dummies can get you started on your way to mastering all these
games, and it uses the light, witty style you have come to know in the
Dummies series, holding your interest and making the process of figuring out
poker fun and entertaining.
I sure wish someone had given me this book a few years ago. And in a way, I
wish that Richard Harroch and Lou Krieger hadn’t written it. The competition
during my World Series of Poker win in 2003 was fierce, and the more people
who read this book, the more good players I’ll have to face each year.
I was fortunate enough to win the 2003 World Championship of Poker, and
walk away with $2.5 million cash. But, as we got down to the final table, in the
middle of one hand, one of the players pulled out Poker For Dummies and
started reading it!
And now, you too can get that advantage by reading this book. Poker players
often say, “it’s better to be lucky than good.” But with this book, and a little
luck, maybe you can find yourself at the final table of the World
Championship.
Poker is a fun, entertaining, and challenging game — all the same characteris-
tics that make Poker For Dummies a valuable read. Give it a few hours of your
time, and you may find that you can start competing with the big boys (and
girls) more quickly than you think.

#«roker has always been America’s game, but poker is changing these days.
W
In a big way. Ask a friend or neighbor with only a casual knowledge of
the game to offer an image of poker, and one of three pictures is likely to
appear:
Poker is a game played by Mississippi riverboat gamblers with pencil-thin
moustaches, fast hands, and a derringer hidden up their ruffled sleeves, or
it’s played by gunfighters of the Old West (men like Doc Holliday, Wild Bill
Hickok, and Bat Masterson). Welcome to Dodge City, pardner. Check your
guns at the marshal’s office and pull up a chair.
Another picture of poker comes right out of the movie, The Sting. Imagine
1930s Chicago mobsters, a round table, a low-hanging lamp illuminating the
thick cigar smoke rising from the ash tray, guys with shoulder holsters and
snub-nosed 38s, a bottle of cheap Scotch on the table, and someone the size
of an NFL linebacker stationed by the peep-hole at the door.
There’s a kinder, gentler version too. This is a picture of Uncle Jack and Aunt
Gertie playing poker around the kitchen table for pennies, and somehow all
the nieces and nephews always come away winners.
Poker has been all of these things, and more. Although your authors are far
too young to have gambled with Doc Holliday or played cards with A1
Capone, both are familiar with the kitchen table introduction to America’s
national card game.
Since the late 1980s, poker has undergone a renaissance, a greening, if you
please. Today’s poker is clean, light, and airy, and decidedly middle class.
Like bowling and billiards before it, poker has moved out from under the
seedier side of its roots and is flowering in the sunshine. No matter where
you live, you probably live within a few hours drive of a public card casino.
Poker is all around you. Seek and ye shall find, and these days you don’t have
to look very far either.
Poker For Dummies
Why\lou Need This Book
If you’ve never played poker seriously before, you might wonder why you
need a book about it. Why can’t you just sit down at the table with a few
friends, or visit that friendly casino nearby and learn as you go?
Well you can learn poker that way, but there are better ways to go about it.
The school of hard knocks can be expensive, and there’s no guarantee you’ll
ever graduate.
Poker’s been around for a long time, and it’s never been more popular. With
the advent of personal computers, a great deal of research about the game
has been done in recent years and some of the tried and true concepts have
been changing. Players who don’t keep their knowledge up to date will be left
behind.
A reference book like Poker For Dummies explains the basic rules of the most
popular variations of poker and provide a sound strategic approach so you
can learn to play well in the shortest amount of time.
You’ll undoubtedly find many poker players who have never picked up a
book on the subject. Some even disdain this new breed of studious poker
players. A few self-taught players are quite skilled, but the majority of them
are not. And even if they’ve been playing for 20 years, that doesn’t mean that
they have not been making the same mistakes day after day, month after
month, and year after year.
Until you are aware of your mistakes it’s impossible to correct them. And
don’t think your opponents are going to point them out either. After all, poker
is played for money. And if you find a leak in your opponent’s game, you’re
going to try to exploit it for all it’s worth — literally.
What We Assume about you
We expect that you could be approaching this book from a variety of back-
grounds. Maybe you’ve never played poker before, and you don’t even know
what a full house is. We cover the basics in this book, so we have you covered.
Or maybe you’ve played poker since you were a kid, and for some reason,
you always lose. So you know the rules, but you just don’t know how to win.
Well, this book certainly can help you. We present all kinds of tips, tricks, and
strategies. It’s time for you to walk away from the poker table with more
money than lint in your pockets.
Introduction
If you’re a poker expert, you still can benefit from what we have to offer.
Some of our suggestions may surprise you, and you can certainly learn from
the anecdotes we’ve peppered throughout the book.
Hotf to Use This Book
This book is a reference, not a tutorial. By that, we mean that you can read
this book in any fashion you wish. You don’t have to read it from cover to
cover to understand where we’re coming from. Say you know all the rules but
want to find out what money management is all about. Jump to Chapter 9 and
start reading. If you just want to get to know just the basics &nd save the
advanced stuff for later, just read the first seven chapters and put the book
away until you’re ready to tackle the rest of the material. And if you really
want to flatter us, go ahead and read the book from cover to cover. We
promise that you’ll enjoy the ride.
HoW This Book Is Organized
We try to keep the discussions in each chapters self-contained, and we group
like chapters into parts. Here’s what each part covers:
Part I: HovU to Play the Games
Poker consists of several games, and we show you how to play almost all of
them. From Texas Hold’em to Seven-Card Stud to Omaha/8 Hold’em, we show
you not only the nuts and bolts of how to play the games, but we also discuss
effective strategies and offer methods for improving your game.
Part II: Advanced Strategy
Playing and winning poker involves much more than the luck of the draw, and
this part covers two pretty important aspects of the game: bluffing and
money management. Chapter 8 offers some guidelines on both performing
bluffs and reading bluffs from other players. In Chapter 9, we actually use
math to help you decide how to proceed when you are winning, losing, and
breaking even.
Poker For Dummies
Part III: Computers, Casinos,
and Cardrooms
You can play poker in more places than just the smoky back room of your
best friend’s house. People are playing poker against computer-generated
opponents, and what’s more exciting is that you can now use the Internet to
join games with real, live opponents from around the world. Video poker
requires special strategies, which we discuss, and we also tell you what goes
on in poker tournaments, including the World Series of Poker.
Part It/: More Poker Fun
This short part contains some information that didn’t really fit in the previ-
ous parts. In Chapter 15, we pull together all of the poker terms, slang, and
myths that you’re likely to encounter. And in Chapter 16, we provide you with
many resources for honing your poker skills.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book ends with top-ten lists, and this one is no exception.
We offer you ten ways to read your opponents, the ten best poker players we
know of , and others.

A signature feature of For Dummies books, besides top-notch authors and the
catchy yellow and black covers, is the use of icons, which are little pictures
we like to throw next to pieces of important text. Here’s what the icons mean:
A suggestion that can help you play better.
A note that will keep you out of trouble.

PartI: How to Play the Games
Poker and the American bream
Poker has always been a microcosm of all we admire about American virtue.
It is part of the very fabric Americans have spent more than 220 years weav-
ing into a national mosaic. Call it the American Dream — the belief that hard
work and virtue will triumph, that anyone willing to work hard will succeed,
that right makes might. It is an immigrant’s song, a mantra of hope; it is an
anthem for everyone.
Poker looks like such a simple game. Anyone, it seems, can play it well —
though nothing, of course, is further from the truth. Learning the rules can
be quick work but becoming a winning player takes considerably longer. Still,
anyone willing to make the effort can become a fairly good player. You can
succeed in poker the way you succeed in life: by facing it squarely, getting
up earlier than the next person, and working harder and smarter than the
competition.
Where bid It All Come From?
A profusion of western movies and gunfighter ballads has convinced the
world that poker is a quintessential^
American game, yet its roots go back
hundreds of years. The Persians were said to play a poker-like game cen-
turies ago. Germans played a bluffing game called Pochen as early as the six-
teenth century; later, there was a French version called Poque. The French
brought this game with them to New Orleans and its popularity spread —
aided by the paddle wheelers that traveled the Mississippi.
Poque soon became known as poker; and the rules were modified during the
Civil War to allow cards to be drawn to improve one’s hand. Stud poker, still
very popular today, appeared at about the same time. (See Chapters 3 and 5
for the full scoop on Stud games.)
People all over the world play poker, with hundred of versions played in
home games everywhere. You can find games going on in casinos and poker
rooms in most of the United States, England, Ireland, France, Holland, Austria,
Germany, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, Aruba, Costa Rica, and probably a
few other countries too. People play for pennies around the kitchen table and
professionally for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Poker is Good for i/ou
Like the American Dream, poker is good for you: It enriches the soul, sharpens
the intellect, heals the spirit, and when played well — nourishes the wallet.
Chapter1: Poker Basics
Above all else, poker forces the player to face reality and deal with it head-on.
Oh, sure, people can ignore those realities— lots of players do. They are the
ones who lose consistently, and rather than face the deficiencies in their own
game, persist in placing the blame on fate, on the dealer, on that particular
deck of cards, or on anything else— except themselves — that’s handy.
But poker can also be bad for you if you don’t know the key strategies and
your own shortcomings. But don’t dismay. You have us to guide you through
the rough waters and jump-start your poker education.
Perhaps British author and poker player Anthony Holden said it best. In Big
Deal: A Year.As A Professional Poker Player he writes: “Whether he likes it or
not, a man’s character is stripped bare at the poker table; if the,other players
read him better than he does, he has only himself to blame. Unless he is both
able and prepared to see himself as others do, flaws and all, he will be a loser
in cards, as in life.”
Your challenge for as long as you aspire to win at poker is this: Be willing to
examine and analyze your character and game. If you do this, and have even
a modicum of talent, you can become a winning poker player.
Before\/ou Put on i/our Poker Face
Like a house, poker requires a foundation. Only when that foundation is
solidly in place can you proceed to build on it. When all the structural ele-
ments are in place, you can then add flourishes and decorative touches. But
you can’t begin embellishing it until the foundation has been poured, the
building framed, and all the other elements that come before it are in place.
That’s our purpose here: to put first things first — to give you a basic under-
standing of what you need before you begin to play.
Planning and discipline
Some poker players, and it’s no more than a handful, really do have a genius
for the game — an inexplicable, Picasso-like talent that isn’t easily defined and
usually has to be seen to be believed. But even in the absence of genius— and
most winning players certainly are not poker savants— poker is an eminently
learnable skill. Inherent ability helps, and while you need some talent, you
really don’t need all that much. After all, you don’t have to be Van Cliburn to
play the piano, Picasso to paint, or Michael Jordan to play basketball. What
you do need to become a winning player are a solid plan to learn the game and
discipline.

with discipline is a key to avoiding losing your shirt — or your shorts.
If you can learn to play poker at a level akin to that of a journeyman musician,
a work-a-day commercial artist, you will be good enough to win consistently.
You don’t have to be a world champion like Doyle Brunson, Phil Hellmuth,
Johnny Chan, or Tom McEvoy to earn money playing poker. The skills of a
good journeyman poker player enables you to supplement your income, or —
better yet— earn your entire livelihood at the game. If you go on to become
the very best poker player you can be, that should be more than enough to
ensure that you will be a lifelong winning player.
The object of the game
The objective of poker is to win money by capturing the pot, which contains
bets made by various players during the hand. A player wagers a bet in
hopes that he has the best hand, or to give the impression that he holds a
strong hand and thus convince his opponents to fold (abandon) their hands.
Since money saved is just as valuable as money won, knowing when to
release a hand that appears to be beaten is just as important as knowing
when to bet. In most poker games, the top combination of five cards is the
best hand.
Number of players
Any number of players, typically from two to ten, can play, depending on the
game. Most casino games are set up with eight players for a seven-card game
like Stud poker or Razz, and nine or ten players for Texas Hold’em.
Chapter 1:Poker Basics
The deck
Most forms of poker involve a standard 52-card deck. For Draw poker and
Lowball, a joker, or “bug,” is sometimes added to the deck. It’s not a wild card
per se, but can be used in Draw poker as an additional ace, or to complete a
straight or flush. In Lowball, the joker is used as the lowest card that does
not pair your hand. For example, if you held 7-6-2-A-Joker, it would be the
same as if you held 7-6-3-2-A.
Poker chips
j
Whether you use pennies or peanuts to bet with at home, nothing beats the
feel of real poker chips. Originally made of clay, chips now come in a durable
composite or plastic. (The plastic ones are a bit more slippery than the com-
posite and, thus, are more difficult to handle.)
Chips are available in a wide range of colors and patterns. The designs and
‘‘edge spots” you see on casino chips vary because of security reasons, but
the colors generally follow a set of traditional dollar values:
$1
White
$5
Red
$25
Green
$100
Black
$500
Purple or Lavender
If you want to add a dose of Vegas-style playing to your home game, then try
using real chips. Following is a list of the number of chips you’ll need:
3 to 4 players
5 to 6 players
7 to 8 players
Large games or
multiple games
300 chips
400 chips

1,000 chips
The Basics of Play
Poker is a simple game to learn, although one can spend a lifetime trying to
master it. You win money by winning pots — the money or chips wagered
during the play of each hand (or round) of poker, from the first cards dealt until
the showdown. A hand also refers to five cards in the possession of a player.
/^
Part I: How to Play the Games
You win hands in one of two ways:
1 i^ You s/tou; dow n Reveal) the best hand at the conclusion of all the bet-
/
ting rounds. When two or more players are still active when all the bet-
ting rounds are done, they turn their hands face up. The pot goes to the
I
player who holds the highest hand during this showdown.
I
y* All your opponents fold their hands. No, this doesn’t mean they
J
politely clasp their fingers on the table in front of them. Folding a hand
|
(or, more simply, folding) means that a player relinquishes his or her
1
claim to the pot by not matching an opponent’s bet.
In this case, you may have had the best hand or you may have been
bluffing— it doesn’t matter. When opponents surrender their claim to
1
the pot, it’s yours.
In games like Seven-Card Stud and Texas Hold’em the best hand is a high
hand. (For more detail about high hands, see the section titled, “Hand
Rankings” in this chapter.) In other games, like Lowball and Razz, the best
hand is a low hand. (The best possible low hand is 5^t-3-2-A; the next best is
6^-3-2-A.)
In split-pot games, two winners split the pot. For example, in Seven-Card Stud,
High-Low Split, Eight-or-Better (mercifully abbreviated as Seven-Stud/8) and
Omaha High-Low Split, Eight-or-Better (or just Omaha/8) the best high hand
and the best low hand split the pot ( provided that someone makes a low
hand composed of five unpaired cards with a rank of 8 or lower). The worst
possible low hand would consist of 8-7-6-5^L The best of all low hands is
5^1-3-2-A (known as a wheel or bicycle). While a high hand always will be
made in split-pot games, there won’t necessarily be a low hand. And when
there’s no low hand, the high hand wins the entire pot.
Most games require ante or blind bets. (See the sidebar titled, “Betting terms”
in this chapter.) If antes are used, each player must post a token amount of
money in order to receive cards. As for blinds, one or two players are
required to make a bet or portion of a bet before the hand is dealt. This
requirement rotates around the table so that each player pays his fair share.
Each time a round of cards is dealt, players have an opportunity to check,
bet, fold, call, or raise. Any time a player decides to forfeit his interest in the
pot, he may release his hand when it is his turn to act (to do something
related to betting: raise, fold, check, or call). When a player folds a hand, he
is not required to place any more money in the pot. If a player bets or raises
and no one calls, the pot belongs to that player, the cards are collected and
shuffled, and the next hand is dealt. If there are two or more players still
active at the end of the hand, the best hand wins the pot.
Chapter 1:Poker Basics
While there are different rules for each specific version, poker really is this
simple. Yet within its simplicity lies a wonderfully textured game structure
that is always fascinating, frequently enjoyable, and, for some, a lifelong
source of pleasure.
Hand Rankings
Seven-Card Stud and Texas Hold’em are the two most popular forms of poker
in which the highest ranking hand wins. These games are played with a 52-
card deck — there is no joker — composed of four suits:spades, hearts, dia-
monds, and clubs. Each suit is equal in value, and there are 13 ranks in each
suit. The ace is the highest ranking card in a suit, followed by king, queen,
jack, and 10 through 2 (or deuce), in descending order. An ace may also be
used as the lowest ranking card in a 5-high straight (5-4-3-2-A), which is also
called a wheel or bicycle.
Although Stud and Hold’em are played with seven cards, the best hand refers
to the best five-card hand. Hand rankings are a function of probability. The
rarer the hand, the more valuable it is. See Figure 1-1 for an at-a-glance look at
hand ranking in descending value.
Royal flush; straight flush
A royal flush is simply an ace-high straight flush, and is the best possible
hand in poker. There are only four of them: AAKAQAJ^ IO*; AvKvQvJvlOv;
A+K+Q+J +10+; and A+K*Q*J*10*.
A straight flush is five cards of the same suit in sequence, such as
9v8v7v6v5v or Q+J +10+9+8*.
Four-of-a-kind
Fourof-a-kind, or quads, is a five-card hand composed of all the cards of one
rank, plus one unrelated card, such as JVJAJ*J*5+. The higher the rank, the
better the hand. For example, four kings beats four jacks.
Full house
Three cards of one rank and a pair of another make a full house. The rank of
the full house is determined by the three-card grouping, not the pair. A hand
like 9V9A9^545* is referred to as “ ... nines full of fives.”

Chapter 1: Poker Basics
Flush
A flush is any five cards of the same suit. The cards are not in sequence. If
they were in sequence, it would be a straight flush. If there is more than one
flush, the winning hand is determined by the rank order of the highest card,
or cards, in the flush. A flush composed of AvQvJv6v5v is higher than
A*Q*J*4*3*.
Straight
Five sequenced cards, not all of the same suit, compose a straight. If more
than one straight is present, the highest card in the sequence determines the
winning hand. A jack-high straight Jv10*9*8*7* will beat this 9*8*746*5*
nine-high straight.
Three-of-a- ftind
Three cards of the same rank, along with two unrelated cards is called three-
of-a-kind. This hand is also referred to as trips, or a set. If you held
8*8v8*K*4* you could refer to it as “ . . . trip 8s,” or “a set of 8s.”
Two pair
Two cards of one rank along with two cards of another rank and one unre-
lated card composes two pair. The higher rank determines which two pair is
superior. If two players hold two pair and each has the same high pair, then
the rank of the second pair determines the winner. If both players hold the
same two pair, then the rank of the unrelated side card determines the win-
ning hand. If the hand is identical, then the players split the pot. For example,
Q*Qv8*8*4* queens and 8s is superior to Q*Q*5*5*K*queens and 5s.
One pair
One pair is simply two cards of one rank and three unrelated cards. If two
players hold the same pair, then the value of the unrelated side cards deter-
mines the winning hand.
/5
Parti: Howto Play the Games
Mo pair
No pair consists of five unrelated cards. When no player has a pair, then the
rank order of the unrelated cards determines the winning hand. For example,
if Harry has A-Q-9-6-3 and Adrien has A-J-l0-3-2, then Harry wins because A-Q
ranks higher than A-J.
Lou/ hands
In split-pot games, like Omaha/8, the best low hand composed of five unre-
lated cards with the rank of 8 or lower, captures half the pot. A hand like
7+6V4A34A+ beats 7^6+5V3AA4 , but will lose to 7*4v3v2+A*.
Determining the best low hand takes a bit of practice, but if you always begin
with the highest of the low cards and continue in descending order, you can’t
go wrong.
Betting
Without betting, poker would just be a game of luck and the best hand would
always win. Betting is the key to poker, and minimizing losses when holding a
poor hand while maximizing wins with good hands is what poker is all about.
Every betting interval requires a check or a bet from the first player to act.
Each player to the left of the first player to act may either check or bet if no
one else has bet. Whoever makes the first bet is said make the opening bet. If
a bet has been made, other players may fold, call, or raise.
When a player folds, he loses any chips he has contributed to that pot and
has no further interest in the hand. After the final betting round a showdown
among the players still active in the hand determines the winner.
Different types of games call for specific kinds of betting:
& In a fixed limit game, no one may bet or raise more than a predetermined
number of chips. This limit, however, usually varies with the round of
the game. In Stud poker, betting limits usually double when the fifth card
is dealt. Thus, a $10-$20 game means that the first two rounds of betting
are based on limits of $10, while the last three are in increments of $20.
In Texas Hold’em, with four betting rounds, betting limits usually double
on the third round.
v* Spread limit games are similar to fixed limit, but the bettors can wager
any amount within the limits. A limit might be $2-$10 any time, which
Chapter 1: Poker Basics
|
means'that wagers can be made in any amount within those limits at any
|
time, with the proviso that a raise must be at least the equal of the bet
|
that preceded it.
I^ In pot limit, bets or raises are limited only by the amount of money in the
i
pot at the time the wager is made. A player who raises may count her
call as part of the pot. If there is $10 in the pot and someone wagers $10,
,
a raiser may call that bet, making the pot $30 and then raise the entire
|
pot. When she is done, the pot will contain $60.
§ v* In no limit, a player may bet or raise any amount of chips she has in
1
front of her at any time.
f
In most limit games, a bet and either three or four raises per bptting round
are permitted.
Betting terms
Following are some of the keyterms to describe
the action that occurs during a poker game:
n
u* Ante:A taken sum of money contributed by
each player before the cards are dealt.
Antes are usedin Seven-Card Stud,Seven-
Stud/8,Razz,andmany other games.
a small blind. These blinds are considered
"five," which means that players who post
the blind havethe opportunityto raise when
the action gets back around to them.
V Bet A wager of a certain amount of money
by a player in a poker game. Bets can either
be in fixed limits, such as $3 and $6, or
spreadlimits,which allow a player to wager
any amount within the limits at any time
(such as$2-$1D). Potlimit\s another form of
wagering, in which a player can bet any
amount up to the sum total currently in the
pot. No-limit poker allows contestants to
wager any amount of money they have in
frontofthem.(For more detail about betting,
see the section titled "Betting" in this
chapter.)
*
Blind bet:A forced betby one or more play-
ers before the cards are dealt. This takes
the place of an ante. The requirement to
post a blind bet rotates around the table
from hand to hand,so that each player pays
*
Call: To equalize the amount wagered by
putting the amount of money wagered into
the pot
Check: A check is a bet of zero dollars. By
checking, a player retains the right to call
any bet made by player who acts after he
does, or even to raise. But if someone's
already bet when it’s your turn to act,you
can no longer check, and must either fold
call,or raise.
Checkraise:To check and then raise if one
of your opponents bets. This is generally
done to trap players for a bet or two,when
the checkraiser has a very powerful hand.
v* Fold:To decide not to call a bet or raise. By
folding,a player relinquishes her interest in
the pot
his fair share. Blind bets are common in
Texas Hold'em and Omaha. In most casino
games there aretwo blinds: a big blind and
Raise:To increase the amount wagered by
an amount equal to your opponent's bet-
or by a greater amount, if the game is
spread limit,pot limit, or no-limit.

Part I:How to Play the Games
Rules of the Road
Call them rules, conventions, or poker etiquette, there are some guidelines
that are common to all forms of poker, especially poker in card clubs or casi-
nos. While you may find some minor variations from one casino to another,
many card casinos are working diligently toward a uniform set of guidelines.
Going all-in
If you don’t have enough to cover the bets and raises, you are said to go all-
in, and are simply contesting that portion of the pot your money covers.
Others who are active in the hand can still make wagers, but those bets con-
stitute a side pot. At the hand’s conclusion, the side pot is decided first, then
the main pot. You are not eligible to win the side pot since you invested no
money in it, but you can win the main pot. You can buy more chips or put
more money on the table between hands.
Few things you remember from Saturday matinee westerns happen in a
public cardroom. Players don’t leave the game in mid-hand, go get the deed
to the ranch, then use it to cover a bet. You cannot drive someone out of a
pot just by betting more money than he has in front of him. The player with
the limited chip supply goes all-in — by calling with the remainder of their
chips. If the all-in player loses, he either buys more chips or leaves the game.
The forbidden string-raise
MHG!
ln a western, someone’s always saying: “ . .. Mighty big bet, cowboy. I’ll just
see your twenty,” while reaching back into his stack for more chips, and with
a long, lingering glance for effect, drawls “ . .. and raise you forty!” As dra-
matic as that move may seem, you won’t see that in a real poker game.
Calling a bet, then reaching back for more chips and announcing a raise is
called a string raise. It is not permitted. Rest assured someone will shout
“String raise!” The dealer then informs the hopeful raiser that a string raise
just occurred, and he’ll have to take his raise back and simply call. Now, if
someone shouts “String raise!” and another opponent says something like
“That’s okay. Let his raise stand,” be assured your hand is in big trouble—
real big trouble!
The string-raise rule prevents a player from reading the reactions of his oppo-
nents while he puts some chips in the pot, then deciding to raise if he thinks
he’s got the best of it.
Chapter 1:Poker Basics
HovO to raise
If you want to raise, just say “Raise.” Then you can go back to your stack and
count out the proper amount of chips. If you want to let your action
announce your intention, you usually must put the correct amount of chips
into the pot, and do it all in one motion. Otherwise . . . string raise.
No splashing
Avoid splashing the pot: Don’t toss chips into the center of the table where
they mingle with the others. Instead, stack your chips neatly on the table '
about 18 inches in front of you. The dealer will pull them into the pot when
the action has been completed on that round of betting.
If it’s your first time in a public cardroom, tell the dealer so he can help you
through the mechanics of the game. After a few sessions, you will be familiar
and comfortable with the majority of playing procedures.Soon you, too, will
feel like a regular.
Protecting gour hand; cards speak
In a casino, unlike in many home games, you are always responsible for your
hand. Toss it in the muck (the pile of discarded cards), and your hand is
fouled and cannot win. The rule in all cardrooms is that cards speak — your
hand is worth whatever value the cards have. Dealers, however, can make
mistakes. If you think yours is the best hand, turn your cards face up and
announce it. Place it halfway between your chips and the pot, and hold on to
it while the dealer determines the outcome.
If you’re not sure whether you have the best hand or not, turn all of your
cards face up at the end of the hand and allow the dealer to read your hand.
If you are in a poker club or casino and there is a doubt or debate, even if the
hand is over, casino security cameras can review the hands that were shown
down in order to determine the winner
Table stakes
Most games, including most casino games are table stakes. You cannot add
chips or money to the amount in front of you during the play of the hand. If
you run out of money during a hand, you can contest only that portion of the
pot that your bets cover. You cannot go light — that is, pull more money out
of your wallet — as you might do in a home game. You can, of course, always
add more money to your playing stake between hands.

Part I: How to Play the Games
Time out
Anytime you are unsure of anything, the best procedure to follow is to call
“Time!” This freezes the action. Then get your questions resolved prior to
acting. Poker etiquette suggests that you not abuse this privilege, particularly
if you are in a game where you are charged a fee for sitting at the table.
Players usually want a fast, efficiently run game, with as few interruptions as
possible.
Decks and dealing
t
Dealers— and decks— generally rotate every half-hour. In addition, players
unhappy with their run of cards are prone to holler “Deck change!” Most card
rooms permit a change once a deck has been in play for an entire round.
The finer points: Etiquette
A
Hj|
Poker rules and etiquette helps speed the game along and keep it orderly.
These conventions are as much a part of the game as the cards themselves.
In fact, when you play casino poker for the first time, poker etiquette may
take more getting used to than the game itself.
Keep in mind the following points of poker protocol:
V Act in turn: Each player is expected to act in turn as play proceeds
clockwise around the table. If someone bets and you plan to discard
your hand, wait until it is your turn to act before doing so. Not only is
acting out of turn impolite, it can give a big advantage to one of your
opponents. If he knows you will fold your hand, it makes it easier for him
to bluff, and is unfair to the rest of the players. In poker, as in most
things, it’s considered polite to wait your turn.
Keep your cards in plain sight: In order to maintain the integrity of the
game, it is important for players to keep their cards on the table during
the play of the hand. The best way to protect your hand is to keep it on
the table, and look at the cards by shielding them with your hands while
lifting a corner of each card to peek at it. In a game like Texas Hold’em.
where players have only two cards in front of them, it is customary to
leave them on the table after looking and to place a chip on top of them.
This alerts the dealer that your hand is still in play.
Avoid discussing hands in play: Discussing your hand with others, even
if you have released it and are no longer contesting that pot, may provide
information that would give another player an unfair advantage. If you
want to discuss a hand with a neighbor, wait until the hand is concluded.
Chapter1: Poker Basics

v* Practice toking; We’re not blowing smoke here, but toking (poker par-
lance for tipping) the dealer is customary when you win a pot. In poker
casinos, tokes constitute a significant part of each dealer’s income. The
size of the pot and the game’s betting limits generally determine the
amount of the toke. If you’re new to casino poker, take your toking cue
from the other players at the table. In games with betting limits of
$10—$20 or higher, a dollar is a typical toke for all but the smallest pots.
In smaller games, tokes of fifty cents are the rule.
What Witt i/our Opponents Be Like7
y
The kinds of players sitting at your table in a poker parlor will vary with the
limits you play. If you play in low-limit games, you are not going to find either
last year’s World Series of Poker winner, the eight toughest card players in
your hometown, or any legends of the game. While there are many ways to
classify players as you try to build a book on your opponents, the easiest
way is to group your opponents into three types: casual recreational players,
regulars, and professionals.
Casual recreational players
Casual recreational players love the game, but when push comes to shove,
they are not that concerned about winning or losing. They play for the fun of
it. It is simply a hobby, and no matter how much they lose, it is less expensive
than keeping horses, restoring classic automobiles, or a hundred other hob-
bies that devour money. Naturally, you’d love to play exclusively with recre-
ational players. If you can’t beat a table full of these players, you just might
want to find something else to do in your spare time. No one, however, will
come right out and admit to being a casual recreational player. If someone
does, watch out. He probably is not, and you’re forewarned: Take heed when
he fires a raise at you.
Cardroont regulars
Regulars come in a wide variety. This includes retirees, homemakers, students,
people with no fixed job hours, dealers who are playing before or after their
shift, and almost anyone else you can imagine.Some regulars have indepen-
dent sources of income and often play in big games. Take it for a fact that all
the regulars you encounter have more playing experience than you do. Even
if you are a stronger player but are just making the transition from home
games to casino poker, they will have the best of it for a while. After all, they
are in playing shape. You, on the other hand, are in spring training and will
need some time to adjust to this entirely new environment.
2
Part I: How to Play the Games
Regulars and casual recreational players constitute the majority of poker
devotees.Some are good. Most aren’t. But they’re in action on a regular basis.
Professionals
You find professionals and semi-professionals in most of the larger games.
Generally speaking, you don’t encounter these players at limits below
$10-$20. While a pro would have an easier time of it at lower betting limits,
she just can’t earn a living in a $2-$4 game. In these lower limit games, you’ll
be competing with regulars and recreational players, not professionals. But
when you graduate to the higher limits you can expect to encounter some
players who earn all or part of their living playing poker.
Proposition players
Proposition players, or props, play on their own money but are paid a salary
by the club to help start or prop up games. You’ll typically find them late at
night when the club is trying to keep games going, and early in the morning
when it’s trying to start up a new game.
A prop’s life can be tough. Playing in short-handed games, or games strug-
gling to get off the ground isn’t always a bed of roses. The minute a live
player wants his seat, the prop is pulled from it— often when the game is
just starting to bear fruit. Props typically play better than most regulars do,
but not as well as top players do. Their defining characteristic is that they
tend to be conservative.
Many cardroom newcomers panic at the thought of a prop in their game.
Since the casino pays the prop, players often believe he has a big advantage.
Not true. They play their own money, and as long as they’re reliable and
maintain a playing bankroll the card club cares not a whit whether they win
or lose. I suspect that given a choice, any cardroom would prefer to employ a
weak player as a prop, rather than a strong one, simply because the weaker
player is a bigger draw. In fact, the ideal prop would be a poor player with a
winning personality and an unlimited bankroll.
Playing in a Casino
Casino poker differs from typical home games. While kitchen-table poker may
be long on camaraderie and unusual variants of the game, there are many
reasons to play in a public cardroom. The most important factor may be that
there is always a game. In fact, you frequently have a choice of games, which
are often available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Chapter 1:Poker Basics
Another major advantage, especially in the very large poker clubs in urban
locations, is the safety of public cardrooms. These venues offer professional
dealers, floorpersons, and video security the equal of any Las Vegas casino to
ensure that games are run squarely. Because people walk around cardrooms
with large sums of money, there are more security guards than you’d find in
most banks. Parking lots are brightly lit, well-patrolled, and free of strong-arm
crime. Since most large clubs offer check cashing, safe deposit boxes, and
ATM machines, there’s no need to walk around with large sums of money in
your pocket. You can also take advantage of the players banks available at
many large clubs. While you can’t write checks against it, a players bank is
like a conventional bank account except that it’s in a casino. You can deposit
money and withdraw cash when you need it.
In a public cardroom there’s never any pressure to stay. Nobody minds if you
quit the game a winner. Someone else is usually waiting for your seat. You do,
however, have to pay to play. It costs more to play in a casino than a home
game where all you have to do is split the cost of food and drinks.
Casinos, however, offer a variety of games. If you don’t feel like playing Texas
Hold’em you can play Stud, Lowball, or Omaha High-Low Split. If weak play-
ers are at your table, you can punish them continuously. Weak players in
home games eventually become ex-players if they can’t win some of the time.
You’ll find the pace of a casino game to be much faster than most home
games. Dealers in a casino try to maintain a quick pace. If you are playing in a
game with a time collection, you are paying the same fee per half-hour of play
regardless of how many hands are dealt. Consequently, dealers act efficiently
and players are expected to make prompt decisions.
Things you’ve probably done in home games just won’t happen in a card
room. No one ever fishes through the discards. The dealer handles the deck.
You play your cards without the help of a neighbor.

Part I: How to Play the Games
HoW to get in a game
When you enter a cardroom, you may see a white board full of players’ ini-
tials. These initials are listed under games that are available. For example, if
you walk into a large casino you might find seven players ahead of you wait-
ing for a $2-$4 Hold’em game. Just give your initials to the board attendant
and indicate the games you want to be listed for. You might say: “My initials
are ABC. Put me up for the $2-$4, $3-$6, and $5—$10 Hold’em, the $5—$10
Stud, and the $4-$8 Omaha High-Low Split games.”
That’s all there is to it. It’s as easy as taking a number at Ben and Jerry’s. Your
initials will go up on the board for each game you request, and you’ll be
called as seats become available. If the board for a particular game is so long
that the club can start another, the attendant will announce that game and
call the players in the order they are listed. When you hear your initials, go to
the table and grab a vacant seat. You’re in the game.
Some cardrooms don’t use a board. Just give your initials or first name to the
attendant and tell him the games you want to play. In small cardrooms, where
there are only one or two tables, ask the dealer if a seat is available or if there
is a waiting list for the game.
Buying chips
When you first sit in the game either the floorperson or dealer will ask you how
much you want in chips. Each game has a minimum buy-in. Give the floorper-
son your money and you’ll get your chips. Large casinos have chip attendants.
One of them will take your money, announce to the table that “Seat five (or
whatever seat you occupy) is playing $200 behind.” That means you bought in
for $200, and the casino is in the process of fetching your chips. You can play
that hand, even though your chips have not yet arrived. The dealer will either
lend you some chips or keep count of how much you owe the pot. Your chips
should arrive about the time that the first hand is played to its conclusion.
Shuffling and dealing
You may never have noticed, but the shuffle procedure in a casino is much
more rigorous than it is in a game with amateur dealers. Home game players
are usually unfamiliar with the mechanics of a good shuffle, and many lack
the manual dexterity to perform one. Well-trained casino dealers assemble
the deck so the cards face the players, frequently preceding that by scram-
bling the cards on the table. This is followed by a four-step procedure of shuf-
fle, shuffle, riffle, and shuffle. Finally, the dealer cuts the deck and deals. The
procedure is efficient, quick, and designed so that no cards are flashed in the
process.
Chapter 1:Poker Basics
Hoiti Casino Poker Differs
from Home Games
If you’ve watched a few games in a card club while waiting for a seat, you’ll
notice that players do not play as many hands as they do in home games.
While there is seldom a spoken agreement to play every hand in a home
game, because of the chummy atmosphere, many players simply play lots of
hands. That’s not the case in a casino. Players are more selective. Still, the
biggest mistakes most players make is playing too many hands and calling on
early betting rounds when they should have folded.
Tighter than home games
Low-limit cardroom games, while tighter than comparable home games, are
still much too loose. In tight games, the players with the stronger hands tend
to enter the pots, while in a looser game, more players enter more pots than
they really should. If you simply play better starting cards than your oppo-
nents do in these low-limit games, you will usually be a favorite (favored to
win money in the long run).
However, you won’t be a favorite in any game right off the mark. Since it will
take you some time to get familiar with cardroom play, give serious consider-
ation to starting in very small-limit games. You’ll probably be paying for
lessons the first five or ten times you play in a public cardroom, and there is
no reason to make these lessons any more expensive than they need be.
If you come from a home game into a public cardroom, especially the fun-to-
play, jam-it-up kind of home game, you quickly realize that you can’t play
every hand, or even many hands, for that matter! You need standards. This is
true for all forms of poker.
Ptagers are more selective
Bobby Baldwin, former World Champion of Poker and now president of the
Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, reflected on his early days at the table: “I was
floating around, trying to figure out which hands were playable, which hands
called for a raise, which hands should be thrown out. Without standards, he
said, “you have to use 90 percent of your concentration deciding each time
what to do with a given hand. All that mental energy should be devoted to
studying your opponents and trying to decipher the small things which made
this hand slightly different from familiar hands you’ve seen in the past.”

Baldwin's advice is succinct. “Never sit in a game without having a precon-
ceived set of guidelines [starting standards] telling you what your minimum
calling hands and raising hands should be.”
After all, you don’t have to play every hand you’re dealt. Folding weak hands
that will prove to be unprofitable in the long run, is — like discretion — the
better part of valor. Each form of poker has its own set of good hands, and
you’ll find out what they are as you work your way through this book. For
now, it’s enough to remember that you should fold more hands than you play.
Games are (aster
The first few times you play in a casino, the speed of the games might startle
you. You may also think that the players are better than your home game
cronies are. But after becoming familiar with the environment, you’ll find that
your skill level is right up there with your opponents’ abilities. Most of them
aren’t students of the game. Recreational players want to have fun and that’s
it. Most of the regulars, who run the gamut of skill levels, don’t bother to
study the game. Though many of them have been playing in cardrooms for
years, they simply repeat and reinforce the same errors they’ve been making
for decades.
Don’t worry too much about the skill level of your opponents when you first
begin playing in a public cardroom. By studying and playing the game you
should soon catch the field — begin to play as well, or better, than your oppo-
nents. Mind you, if you live in an area in which poker has only recently been
legalized, you probably don’t have any catching up to do at all. You can start
ahead of the crowd and never look back. Think of yourself as a wire-to-wire
winner. Your opponents may improve slowly, simply through osmosis. But
through frequent play and study, you can improve at a much more rapid rate.

asic strategic knowledge is critical for any poker player. If you have no
basis for making decisions about whether to call, fold, raise, or reraise,
then you might just as well play the lottery. Sure, you’ll win occasionally
because everyone gets lucky now and then. Without strategy and knowledge,
you’ll exercise no control over your destiny as a card player.
If you picked 100 poker players at random and asked them about the objec-
tive of poker, most would say something about winning the pot, but they
couldn’t be further from the truth.
BE*
ill
The goal of poker — in addition to the enjoyment of playing the game — is
winning money, not pots. If your goal was to win the most pots, that would be
easy to do. Just play every hand and call every bet and raise until the bitter
end. You’d win a lot of pots. In fact, you’d win every pot you possibly could.
But you’d lose money Plenty of it, and rapidly.
So the objective of poker is to win money. And that means tempering enthusi-
asm with realism by being selective about the hands you play. There’s no
need to play every hand. The very best players play relatively few hands, but
when they do enter a pot they are usually aggressive and out to maximize the
amount they win when the odds favor them.
This is the essence of poker: Anyone can win in the short run, but in the long
haul — when the cards even out — the better players win more money with
their good hands, and lose less with weak hands, than their adversaries.
30
PartI: How to Play the Games
Because of the short-term luck involved, poker is a game where even atro-
ciously poor players can — and do — have winning nights. This is not true in
most other competitive endeavors. Most of us would not have a prayer going
one-on-one with an NBA basketball player, or attempting to hit a 95 mph big-
league fastball. What’s more, we realize it. Yet most of us think we are good
poker players.
If you took a poll at any poker table, the majority of players would rate them-
selves significantly above average. But that’s not the case. It can’t be. In the
long run, good players beat bad players— though the bad players will win
just often enough to keep them coming back for more.
It’s this subtle blend of skill and luck that balances the game. That balance also
rewards good players who are' realistic about how they assess their ability and
that of their opponents. This chapter can help you develop those skills.
What Poker Is and Isn't
Poker is not one game but a variety of games that employ hand rankings, bet-
ting, and bluffing as strategic and tactical elements. In some forms of poker,
like Seven-Card Stud, Texas Hold’em, Five-Card Draw poker, and Omaha, the
best poker hand wins. What’s the best hand? The rarer the hand, the higher
it’s ranked. Thus a straight flush, which is much less likely to occur than a full
house, is ranked higher. That’s why three-of-a-kind beats two pair, which in
turn beats one pair.
In other games, like Lowball, Razz, or Deuce-to-Seven Kansas City Lowball,
the lowest-ranked hand wins. In all but Kansas City Lowball, a hand com-
posed of 5^1-3-2-A— called a wheel or a bicycle — is the best possible hand.
In Kansas City, where straights and flushes count against you and an ace is
always a high card, the best hand is 7-5-4-3-2. But don’t worry about that
game, it’s not played very often. When it is, it’s generally a high stakes, no-
limit game — one you’d be better off avoiding for a long, long time.
If this isn’t enough to confuse you, there are also split games, in which the
highest and lowest hand split the pot. These games are usually played with
an “8 qualifier.” In order to split the pot, the low hand needs to be composed
of five unpaired cards with the rank of 8 or lower. If there is no low hand, the
high hand scoops the entire pot.
In casinos the two most popular “split” games are Omaha 8-or-Better,
High/Low Split (usually abbreviated as Omaha/8) and Seven-Card Stud, 8-or-
Better, High-Low Split (usually abbreviated Seven-Stud/8).
Chapter 2: Essential Strategic Considerations ^
/
We Were /4ft Beginners Once
In the beginning, we were all bad players— you, me, the guy winning all the
money at your table tonight, as well as every player who has ever won the
World Series of Poker. We were all bad. Once upon a time, Troy Aikman could-
n’t throw a football, Ken Griffey Jr. couldn’t hit, and Michael Jordan was once
cut from his high school basketball team. They were beginners too, and guess
what: They were bad. Raw talent? Sure, they were blessed with an abundance
of raw talent, but they all had to work long and hard to refine it.
So don’t bemoan your current skill level as a poker player. You can improve,
and you will if you’re willing to pay the price. Every good poker player has
been where you are now, and they’ve improved. To be sure, some progressed
by leaps and bounds, while others have taken baby steps, one after the other,
until they reached their goal.
Build a foundation first . . .
You can reach your poker-playing goals. You do have some innate potential
as a poker player, and if playing winning poker is important, you need to
build a foundation that will help you reach your potential as quickly as possi-
ble. Everyone who has progressed from neophyte to journeyman to expert to
superstar shares one trait in common: They built a solid foundation, and that
foundation allowed them to spread their wings and fly. And fly they can.
But in poker, as in life itself, you can’t fly until you’ve built a rock-solid foun-
dation and mastered the fundamentals. If you’re still grappling with funda-
mentals, you’re not yet ready to fly. But once those fundamentals are
imprinted on your poker consciousness and you can execute them instinc-
tively, then, and only then,can you think about digressing from these basics
and improving.
. . . Then you can improvise
When you listen to great jazz musicians, you are hearing improvisation at its
best. That improvisation, however, is based on a solid grounding of music
theory. Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Sonny Rollins,
Gerry Mulligan, Charles Mingus, Thelonius Monk: These jazz giants are mas-
ters of improvisation, but their innovation and creativity stood on a platform
of musical theory, knowledge of time signatures, an understanding of har-
mony, skill in ensemble playing, and an ability to use rhythm to underpin
32
Par* I: How to Play the Games
melodic themes and harmony. Without possessing these basic skills, innova-
tion would not have been possible. The price wasn’t cheap, either. It took lots
of playing, lots of years, and more clubs, sessions, and after-hours joints than
those musicians would want to count. But the product was sweet, free-flow-
ing music: riffs that seem to possess a life of their own, springing unbounded
from horns, keyboards, and strings, and filling the night with magic.
Your first efforts should center on learning basic poker concepts. Even when
you understand them, this know-how must be continuously applied. The
knowledge and abilities that compose basic poker skills are not a pill to be
swallowed once. They need to be continuously refined.
Andres Segovia, the greatest classical guitarist of his generation, did not
spend the majority of his practice time learning new pieces or practicing his
concert repertoire. He spent four to six hours per day playing scales and
etudes. Segovia spent 75 percent of his practice time on basics, and did this
every day. You’ll have to take our word for it, but this analogy holds true for
poker, too.
Understand blinds and antes
Every poker game begins as a chase for the antes or blinds. An ante is a small
portion of a bet contributed by each player to seed the pot at the beginning
of each hand.
A blind is a forced bet by one or more players before any cards are dealt. In
Stud games, players usually ante; in Texas Hold’em and Omaha Hold’em,
blind bets are used. Regardless of whether a blind or an ante is employed,
every game needs seed money to start the action. Without it, players could
wait all day for unbeatable hands before entering the pot.
Playing for an empty pot would make for a slow and boring game. Blinds and
antes serve the same purpose:to tempt and tantalize players, enticing them
into the pot and creating action because there’s a monetary target to shoot at.
Know your opponents
Suppose you’re playing Texas Hold’em and have been dealt AvKv, and your
opponents are Rick and Barbara, two players who are known for calling much
too frequently.
Chapter 2: Essential Strategic Considerations
“Fantastic,” you say to yourself when you look at the flop and see Jv5¥9*. “I
have position, two overcards, and a nut-flush draw” You remember some-
thing about semi-bluffing and implied odds, and when your opponents check
on the flop, you bet. They call. The turn brings 4*
, and it’s checked to you.
You bet, thinking that they might fold and you can win it right here.

Part I: How to Play the Games
Maybe you even have the best hand and would win in a showdown right now.
Perhaps a heart — or even an ace or king— will come on the river (at the last
common card). But you are up against players who sleep very well, thank
you, each and every night of the week, secure in the knowledge that no one,
but no one, ever steals a pot from them.
The river is no help; it’s 4*. Rick and Barbara check again. You still might
have the best hand if you show it down. But you bet and you’re called, and
you lose to Rick, who holds a 6-5 of mixed suits.
“What went wrong?” you ask yourself. “1 had the perfect opportunity to semi-
bluff.” Perfect, that is, only from the perspective of the cards on the table and
those in your hand. But it was far from perfect if you stopped to consider
your opponents. Your mistake'involved considering only the cards while
choosing a strategy. Semi-bluffing doesn’t work with players who always call.
You have to show them the best hand to take the money. While there was
nothing you could have done to win that pot, you certainly could have saved
a bet on the river.
Nothing was wrong with the strategy itself. It might have worked if the cards
were the same but your opponents were different. Knowing your opponents
is as important to winning at poker as understanding strategic concepts.
4k
Strategy is situationally dependent. Skilled players realize they need to be
aware of the big picture while simultaneously paying attention to small
details. Understanding strategic concepts is only part of the battle. How,
and under what circumstances to apply them, are equally important. If you
can do this, you will find that you have become a better player and a more
creative one, too.
Prepare to Win
Success demands preparation. Knowledge, plus preparation and experience
(and whatever innate talent one may have), equals know-how. That’s what it
takes to be a winning poker player. If you have that knowledge and you’re
losing, or you’re just not winning as much and as often as you should, see
Chapter 20, “(Almost) Ten Things to Consider Before Going Pro.”

The primary step in making behavioral changes and eliminating bad habits is
to be responsible for you. Adopt the irrevocable assumption that you are per-
sonally responsible for what happens to you at the poker table. If you put the
blame on forces outside of yourself , you have not committed yourself to
making changes; you’re denying the problem.

Chapter 2:Essential Strategic Considerations
A Little Probability
Consider a simple coin toss. With a very large number of tosses, do you
believe that the number of heads and tails would be exactly the same? If you
do, then you would also believe that these simulated players, each pro-
grammed to play identically from a strategic perspective, should have identi-
cal results after 3 million hands.
Understanding poker’s fluctuations can provide some perspective when con-
sidering your short-term results. Not only can fluctuations persist for a long
time before results can be attributed solely to skill, but there is no guarantee
you will balance your books after the last hand is dealt. AtUhat probability
theory offers is the likelihood that your results will parallel your ability.
A short-term simulation
We used a computer to simulate 60,000 hands of $20-$40 Hold’em. That’s
about one year of play if you treated poker as a job and went at it eight hours
a day. The objective was to determine how long it would take to get into “the
long run,” that elusive zone where luck is filtered out and only skill deter-
mines who wins and loses.
Because identical player profiles were loaded into the computer, the long-run
expectation was zero. With identical profiles, each player should neither win
nor lose. They should have broken even in the long run.
Nevertheless, there were four losers and five winners. Seat 9 lost $3.18 per
hour while seat 6 won at the rate of $1.99. That’s a difference of more than $5
per hour — and it was clear they never got into the long run, even after a
year of simulated play.
A long-term simulation
If a year was insufficient to get into the long run, what about a lifetime? The
computer was asked to play 3 million hands of $20-$40 Hold’em. At 30 hands
per hour, 2,000 hours per year, that’s 50 years of poker— about as long a run
as we’re likely to get.
After 50 simulated years, the big winner was ahead $60,214. The big loser was
stuck $35,953. That’s 60 cents per hour for the winner, while the big loser was
in the red about 35 cents per hour. All the others at the table had results
somewhere in between.
35
36
Part I: How to Play the Games
Did they get into the long run? Or does the 95 cents per hour difference
between the big winner and big loser mean that even a lifetime isn’t sufficient
to get into the long run? Some probability theory will help us here.
Probability theory makes no promise to balance the books over the long
haul. All it offers is this: The coin is as likely to come down heads as tails. Not
that it will, only that it is as likely to. Because there is no reason why a coin
should land on one side rather than the other, they are both equally likely to
happen. Still, don’t expect exactly half-and-half — even in a large sample.
While you can expect results close to theoretical probability, remember this:
The coin doesn’t have a memory to give it heads this time and tails the next.
If you carry that logic over to the nine computerized Hold’em players, each
had an equally likely chance tb win. With identical playing profiles, each
player’s expectation was break even.The fact that they did not break even
does not negate probability theory After all, a break-even prediction was the
best forecast you could have made, and there’s no way anyone could logi-
cally predict seat three would win 60 cents per hour and seat one would lose
35 cents per hour. Maybe the best you can expect over a lifetime of poker is
that only 1 to 1.5 percent of your results would be attributable to luck.
HouJ many bad players does it take
to make a yood yame?
In another simulation, two poorer players were introduced into the game.
One played exceedingly tight. The other was much too loose. They also
played for 50 years. The results: Mr. Too-Tight lost $3 million while Loose-Lee
dropped nearly $4 million. Each of the seven other players was a lifelong
winner in this game. The biggest winner was up $1.2 million. The smallest
winner was ahead nearly $800,000.
These are pretty significant results, and they show the importance of game
selection. Simply by substituting two poor players in this game (and they did
not play that poorly, just somewhat worse than their competition), the big
winner went from 60 cents to $12 per hour — a twentyfold increase.
Game selection, according to inferences that can be drawn from these simula-
tions, is crucial to a winning player’s long-term success. Why is it so impor-
tant? Every subsequent decision made at the table relates only to the hand
you are involved in. Game selection, however, has implications for every
hand that you choose to play — or refrain from playing — when you are at
the table.
Chapter 2: Essential Strategic Considerations
Some Poker Perspective
The information explosion is everywhere, and poker is no different. More has
been written about poker since 1985 than had previously been written in the
entire history of the game.
Once you’ve made a commitment to reach for the stars, you have to decide
where to begin. If you aspire to poker excellence, the first — and probably
the most important step— is to develop a perspective that enables you to
put each piece of information, each drop of data, each factoid, into a hierar-
chical structure. After all, some things are just a lot more important than
others, and you might as well concentrate your efforts where they’ll do the
most good.
Why some tactics are important
in poker and others aren't
Imagine that we could teach you a terrific tactical ploy that would require
some real study and practice to perfect — but once learned, could be used to
earn an extra bet from an opponent. What if we also guaranteed this ploy to
be absolutely foolproof: It would work perfectly every time you used it. Have
we piqued your interest?
But suppose that we also told you that this tactic works only in very special
circumstances that occur about once a year. Do you still want to invest the
time required to learn it? Probably not. While your ability to execute this par-
ticularly slick maneuver might brand you as a tough player in the eyes of
your opponents, the fact that you might use it only once a year renders it
meaningless. In the course of a year’s worth of playing, one extra bet doesn’t
amount to a hill of beans. It doesn’t even amount to a can of beans.
Frequent decisions
Tactical opportunities that occur all the time are important. Even when the
amount of money attributed to a wrong decision is small, it will eventually
add up to a tidy sum if that error is made frequently Always defending your
small blind in Hold’em, for example, is a good example. You have to decide
whether to defend your small blind every round — and that’s frequent. If you
always defend it, you are investing part of a bet on those occasions when it is
wrong to do so. At the end of a year, those mistakes add up.
37
Part I: Howto Play the Games
Suppose that you’re playing $10—$20 Texas Hold’em, with $5 and $10 blinds,
and you decide to always defend your small blind, even when you’re dealt
hands like 7v2*. Just to keep this simple, we’ll assume that your small blind
is never raised. Based on the random distributions of cards, you’re probably
dealt a throwaway hand about one-third of the time. At the rate of 30 hands
per hour, you’ll be dealt the small blind three times every 60 minutes. If you
always call, you’ll wind up calling once each hour when you really shouldn’t
have. That’s only $5 each hour, but after 1,000 hours of poker, you’ve essen-
tially given away $5,000. It adds up fast, doesn’t it?
Costly decisions
i
Playing correctly requires a great deal of judgment — the kind that comes
from experience, not books. No matter how skilled a player you eventually
become, you’ll never reach the point where you always make these decisions
correctly. Don’t worry; that’s not important. Just err on the side of protecting
yourself from catastrophic mistakes, and you’ll be on the right track.
Decisions that cost a significant amount of money when they occur, even if
they don’t happen too often, are also important. If you can’t decide whether
to call or fold once all the cards are out and your opponent bets into a fairly
large pot, that’s an important decision. If you make a mistake by calling when
you should have folded and your opponent wins the pot — that’s an error,
but not a critical one. It cost only one bet. But if you fold the winning hand,
that’s a critical error, since the cost of that error was the entire pot.
Now we’re certainly not advising you to call each and every time someone
bets on the last card and you’re unsure about whether you have the best
hand, but deciding to call instead of fold doesn’t have to be correct too often
to render it the yistake of choice. If the cost of a mistaken fold is ten times
the price of a mistaken call, you only have to be correct slightly more than 10
percent of the time to make calling worthwhile.
Decisions and subsequent actions
Choices can also be important because of their position on the decision tree.
Those that are first in a long sequence of subsequent choices are always
important, because subsequent choices are usually predicated on your initial
selection. Make an incorrect move up front and you run the risk of rendering
each subsequent decision incorrect, regardless of whatever else you might
do. That’s why the choice of which hands you start with in poker is generally
a much more critical decision than how you play on future betting rounds. If
you adopt an “ . . . any cards can win” philosophy, you have set yourself up
for a disaster that even the best players could not overcome on later rounds.
Chapter 2:Essential Strategic Considerations
Poker’s single most important decision
*
Choosing the right game is the most important decision you’ll encounter as a
poker player. Choose the wrong game and little else matters. Choose the right
game and you might even make money even on nights when you’re experi-
encing a below average run of cards.
Starting standards
After you choose the best game and select the best available seat (check out
the sidebar “Getting the best seat in the house”) at that table, what’s impor- ,
tant to winning play? Early decisions predicate subsequent choices, so decid-
ing which hands to start with (your starting standards) is critically important.
It’s only human nature to seek the best bang for the buck, and poker players are
no different. There are hands where the return on your investment is positive,
and others that will prove costly in the long run. In the heat of battle, you don’t
have the time to thoroughly assess your hand. You should have made these
decisions long before you hit the table. That’s whystandards are critical. If you
incorporate solid starting standards into your game, you are light years ahead
of any opponent who has not done this— never mind how long he’s been play-
ing or how much experience he may have in other phases of the game.
Starting standards also provide a basis for deviation, but only under the right
conditions. Those conditions are impossible to recognize — and capitalize
on — unless you’ve developed standards and integrated them so completely
into your game that they are second nature to you. Only when that’s accom-
plished can you hope to find those very few exceptions that allow you to
profitably deviate from them.
Hand selectivity
Hand selection is one of the most important keys to winning. Most of us play
too many hands. I’m not referring only to beginners. Some players have been
at it for years, and the single most important flaw in their game is that they
still play too many hands.
After all, the majority of poker players are recreational players. They’re not
playing poker to make their living; they play to enjoy themselves — and
much as they’d have you believe their goal in playing is to win money, that’s
really secondary to their main objective: having fun. The difference between
a player who has come out to have fun and another who is playing to win
money is that the recreational player will look for reasons to play marginal
hands and to continue playing them even when subsequent betting rounds
39
Part I: How to Play the Games
are fraught with danger. The money player will look for reasons to release
hands, avoid unnecessary danger, and dump speculative hands whenever the
potential reward is overshadowed by the risks.
Be aggressive, but be selective
Winning poker requires selectivity and aggression. Every top player knows that
concept, and every credible poker book emphasizes it. If you have any doubts,
consider the need to be selective. Picture someone who calls every hand down
to the bitter end unless he sees that he is beaten on board. Her opponents
would soon discover that it never pays to bluff her. Of course, every time they
had the smallest edge, they’d bet, knowing that she will call with the worst of
it. These value bets would soon relieve our heroine of her bankroll.
If selectivity is clearly correct, what about aggression? Consider the passive
player. He seldom bets unless he has an unbeatable hand — and they don’t
come around all that often. More often than not you’ll find yourself in pots
where you believe, but aren’t absolutely certain, that you have the best hand.
Even when you are 100 percent certain that yours is the best hand at the
moment, you might recognize it as one that can be beaten if there are more
cards to come. This occurs more often than you might realize, and you can’t
win at poker by giving your opponent a free card. If they have to draw to beat
you, make them pay the price.

Chapter 2: Essential Strategic Considerations
Patience
Patience is certainly related to the “be selective” portion of the “be aggres-
sive, but be selective” mantra. Few players dispute the need to be selective.
Nevertheless, most aren’t very selective about the hands they play After all,
poker is fun, and most aficionados come to play, not fold.
When the cards aren’t coming your way, it’s very easy to talk yourself into
taking a flyer on marginal hands. But there’s usually a price to be paid for
falling off the good-hands wagon.
Sometimes it all boils down to a simple choice. You can have a lot of fun,
gamble it up, and pay the inevitable price for your pleasure, or you can apply,
the patience required to win consistently.
Position
In poker, position means power. It is almost always advantageous to act after
you’ve had the benefit of seeing what your opponents do. Their actions pro-
vide clues about the real or implied values of their hands. This is true in
every poker game, and is particularly important in fixed-position games, like
Hold’em and Omaha. In these games position is fixed for the entire hand,
unlike Stud, where it can vary from one betting round to another.

Coping When Alt GoesWrong
Unfortunately, no magic elixir eliminates the fluctuations everyone experi-
ences at poker. But it’s little consolation when you’ve been buffeted by the
vicissitudes of fate to realize that you’re not the only poor soul tossing about
in the same boat. When all seems lost, you need to remember this: There is
opportunity in adversity. In fact, losing provides the best opportunity to
examine and refine your own game.
Let’s face it. Most players don’t spend much time in careful self-examination
when they are winning. It’s too much fun to stack the chips and revel in the
money that’s rolling in. But when they lose, they pore over each decision
they made, wondering how they could have improved it. “What could 1 have
done differently,” they ask over and over. Losing turns them from expansive
extroverts into brooding introverts whose inner-directed thoughts dredge
them back over the same ground time and time again, in search of reasons
and strategies that will prevent losses like these from ever happening again.
If you're on a losiny streak
While no guarantees about future losses are available, we do recommend one
course of action to any player mired in a losing streak: Just change gears. We
all change gears during a poker game, sometimes consciously, as a planned
strategy, and sometimes we just wind up playing differently than we did when
we first sat down.
When you’re losing, consider gearing down. Way down. This is a time for lots
of traction and not much speed; a time for playing only the best starting
hands. Not marginal hands, not good — or even very good — starting hands,
but only the best hands. That means you’ll be throwing away hand after
hand, and it takes discipline to do this, particularly when some of these
hands would have won.
When losing, most players want to minimize fluctuations in their bankrolls
and grind out some wins. Gearing down accomplishes this, because you’re
not playing any of the “close call” hands you normally might. By playing
hands that have a greater chance of winning, you’re minimizing the fluctua-
tions that occur with speculative hands. Of course, you’re also cutting down
your average hourly win rate, but it’s a trade-off , because you are less apt to
find yourself on a roller coaster ride. You can still win as much; it will just
take more hours at the table.
Chapter 2:Essential Strategic Considerations
Narrow the target
Gearing down also prevents your opponents from kicking you when you’re
down. When you’re winning, your table image is quite different than when
you’re losing. Win, and you can sometimes bluff with impunity. It’s a lot
tougher when you’re losing. After all, your opponents have watched you lose
hand after hand. They believe you’re going to keep losing. When you bet,
they’ll call — or even raise — with hands they might have thrown away if you
had been winning steadily.

even-Card Stud is the most popular of all the stud games, and has been
since it first appeared sometime around the Civil War. There are also six-
and five-card variants, but they are not nearly as popular as the seven-card
version. With three down cards and four exposed cards in each player’s hand
at the end of the hand, Seven-Card Stud combines some of the surprises of
Draw poker, with a good deal of information that can be gleaned from four
open cards.
Seven-Card Stud has five rounds of betting that can create some very large
pots. Skilled Seven-Card Stud players need an alert mind and good powers of
retention. A skillful player has the ability to relate each card in his hand, or
visible in the hand of an opponent, to once-visible but now folded hands, in
order to estimate the likelihood of making his hand, as well as to estimate the
likelihood that an opponent has made his.
In Seven-Card Stud almost every hand is possible. This is very different than
a game like Texas Hold’em, in which a full house or four-of-a-kind isn’t possi-
ble unless the board contains paired cards, and a flush is impossible unless
the board contains three cards of the same suit.
With nearly endless possibilities, Seven-Card Stud is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle.
One must combine knowledge of exposed and folded cards with previous bet-
ting patterns in order to discern the likelihood of any one of a variety of
hands that your opponent might be holding.

Part I:How to Play the Games
Because there are five betting rounds, contesting a pot can become quite
expensive, particularly if yours is the second-best hand.
If you've Never Played Seven-Card

Seven-Card Stud requires patience. Since you’re dealt three cards right off the
bat — before the first round of betting — it’s important that these cards are
able to work together before you enter a pot. In fact, the most critically
important decision you’ll make in a Seven-Card Stud game is whether to enter
the pot on third street — the first round of betting.
The next critical decision point is whether you should continue playing on
the third round of betting, called fifth street. In fixed-limit betting games, such
as $6 —$12, fifth street is where the betting limits double. There’s an old adage
in Seven-Card Stud: If you call on fifth street, you’ve bought a through-ticket
to the river card (the last card).

At the conclusion of the hand, when all the cards have been dealt, the results
are as follows:
Player 1 now has a full house, aces full of 4s. He is likely to raise.
Player 2 has an ace-high diamond flush.
Player 3, who began with a promising straight draw, has two pair — 9s
and 8s.
47
Part I: How to Play the Games
Player 4 has a full house, queens full of jacks, but will lose to Player l’s
bigger full house.
Player 5 has three 5s, the same hand she began with.
Player 6 has a king-high straight.
In Seven-Card Stud, each player make the best five-card hand from his seven
cards. The highest hand out of all the players wins. (In Figure 3-1, Player 1
takes the pot.)
While most stud games do not result in this many big hands contesting a pot,
you can see how the best hand changes from one betting round to another,
and how a player can make the hand he is hoping for yet not have any chance
of winning.
'
Antes, the Deal, anti the Betting
Structure
Before the cards are dealt each player posts an ante, which is a fraction of a
bet. Each poker game begins as a chase for the antes, so this money seeds
the pot.
Players are then dealt two cards face down, along with one face up. The lowest
exposed card is required to make a small bet of a predetermined denomina-
tion. This bet (and the person who makes this bet) is called the bring-in. If two
or more players have an exposed card of the same rank, the determining factor
is the alphabetical order of suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades.
Betting
The player to the immediate left of the bring-in has three options. He may fold
his hand, call the bring-in, or raise to a full bet. In a $20-$40 game, the antes
are usually $3 and the bring-in is $5. The player to the bring-in’s left can either
fold, call the $5 bring-in bet, or raise to $20— which constitutes a full bet.
If that player folds or calls the bring-in, the player to his immediate left has
the same options. As soon as someone raises to a full bet, subsequent play-
ers must fold, call the full bet, or raise again.
Once betting has been equalized, a second card is dealt face-up and another
round of betting ensues. This time, however, it is in increments of full bets.
The player with the highest-ranking board cards (cards that are face up) acts
first.
Chapter 3:Seven-Card Stud ^^
The first player to act may either check (a check, in actuality, is a bet of noth-
ing) or bet. If a player has a pair showing (called an open pair), whether that
pair resides in her hand or that of an opponent, she has the option to make a
big bet in most cases. For example, in a $20-$40 game, the betting is still in
increments of $20 on fourth street, except when there is an open pair. Then it
is the discretion of any bettor to open for either $20 or $40, with all bets and
raises continuing in increments that are consistent with the bet.(If the first
two cards dealt face up to Brenda in a $20-$40 Stud game were a pair of jacks,
then she or anyone else involved in that hand can bet $40 instead of $20.)
This rule allows someone with an open pair to protect her hand by making a
larger wager.
Raising
Most casinos allow three or four raises per betting round, except when only
two players contest the pot. In that case, there is no limit to the number of
raises permitted.
In Stud, the order in which players act (called position) is determined by the
cards showing on the board and can vary from round to round. With the
exception of the first round of betting on third street, where the lowest
ranked card is required to bring it in, the highest hand on board acts first and
has the option of checking or betting.
The highest hand could range anywhere from four-of-a-kind, to trips (three-of-
a-kind), to two pair, to a single pair, or even the highest card, if no exposed
pair is present.
Double bets
Betting usually doubles on fifth street, except if there’s a player on fourth
street who holds a pair. When there is, anyone involved in the hand has the
option of making a double bet and those players still contesting the pot are
dealt another exposed card. Sixth street is the same. The last card, called sev-
enth street or the river, is dealt face down. At the river, active players have a
hand made up of three closed and four exposed cards. The player who acted
first on sixth street acts first on seventh street too.

Part I: How to Play the Games
ShouldoWn
If more than one player is active after all the betting has been equalized,
players turn their hands face up, making the best five-card hand from the
seven cards they are holding, and the best hand wins in a showdown (see
Figure 3-1).
Spread-limit games
Many low-stakes Seven-Card Stud games used spread limits rather than fixed
limits. Many casinos will spread $1—$3 or $1—$4 Seven-Card Stud games.
These games are usually played without an ante. The low card is required to
bring it in for $1, and all bets and raises can be in increments from $1—$4 —
with the provision that all raises be at least the amount of the previous bet. If
someone bets $2 you can raise $2, $3, or $4— but not $1. If the original
bettor had wagered $4, you can fold, call his $4 bet, or raise to $8.
Knout When to Hold’em and Knout When
to Fold'em
Seven-Card Stud requires a great deal of patience and alertness. Most of the
time, you should discard your hand on third street because your cards either
don’t offer much of an opportunity to win, or they may look promising but
really aren’t because the cards you need are dead. (For details about dead
cards, see the section titled “The Importance of Live Cards” in this chapter.)
What Kind of Hands Are Likely To Win?
Winning Seven-Card Stud generally takes a fairly big hand (usually two pair,
with jacks or queens as the big pair). In fact, if all the players in a seven-
player game stayed around for the showdown, the winning hand would be
two pair or better more than 97 percent of the time. Even two pair is no guar-
antee of winning, however, since 69 percent of the time the winning hand
would be three-of-a-kind or better, and 54 percent of the time the winning
hand would be at least a straight.
A straight is the median winning hand: Half the time the winning hand is a
straight or better, half the time a lesser hand will win the pot.
Chapter 3:Seven-Card Stud
If you plan to call on third street, you need a hand that has the possibility of
improving to a fairly big hand.
Since straights and flushes are generally not made until sixth or seventh
street, you should raise if you have a big pair (10s or higher). In fact, if some-
one else has raised before it’s your turn to act, go ahead and reraise— as
long as your pair is bigger than his upcard.The goal of your raise is to cause
drawing hands to fold so that your big pair can win the pot — particularly if it
improves to three-of-a-kind or two pair.
Big pairs play better against a few opponents, while straights and flushes are
hands that you’d like to play against four opponents (or more). It’s important
to realize that straights and flushes start out as straight- and flush-draws.
Draws are hands with no immediate value and won’t grow into full-fledged
straights and flushes very often. But these draws have the potential of grow-
ing into very big hands, and those holding them want a lot of customers
around to pay them off whenever they are fortunate enough to complete
their draw.
The Importance of Live Cards
Stud poker is a game of live cards. If the cards you need to improve your
hand are visible in the hands of your opponents or have been discarded by
other players who have folded, then the cards you need are said to be dead.
But if those cards are not visible, then your hand is live.
Many beginning Seven-Card Stud players are overjoyed to find a starting
hand that contains three suited cards. But before you blithely call a bet on
third street, look around and see how many cards of your suit are showing. If
you don’t see any at all, you’re certainly entitled to jump for joy.
But if you see three or more of your suit cavorting in your opponents’ hands,
then folding your hand and patiently waiting for a better opportunity may be
the only logical course of action.
Even when the next card you are dealt is the fourth of your suit and no other
cards of your suit are exposed, the odds are still 1.12-to-l against completing
your flush. Of course if you complete your flush, the pot will certainly return
more than 1.12-to-l, so it pays to continue on with your draw. But remember:
Even when you begin with four suited cards, you’ll make a flush only 47 per-
cent of the time. (The sidebar “Consider the odds” offers more statistics.)
If you don’t make your flush on fifth street, the odds against making it
increase to 1.9-to-l — which means you’ll get lucky only 35 percent of the
time. And if you miss your flush on sixth street, the odds against making your
flush increase to 4.1-to-l. With only one more card to come you can count on
getting lucky about only 20 percent of the time.

limit
This also holds true for straight draws. If your first four cards are 9-10-J-Q,
there are four kings and an equal number of eights that will complete your
straight. But if three kings and an eight have already been exposed, the odds
against completing a straight are substantially higher and the deck is now
stacked against you, and even the prettiest looking hands have to be released.
The first three cards are critical
Starting standards are important in Seven-Card Stud, just as they are in any form
of poker. Those first three cards you’ve been dealt need to work together or
contain a big pair to make it worthwhile for you to continue playing.
Position
Position (your place at the table and how it affects betting order) is impor-
tant in every form of poker, and betting last is a big advantage. But unlike
games like Texas Hold’em and Omaha, where position is fixed for all betting
Chapter 3: Seven-Card Stud
rounds during the play of a hand, it can vary in stud. The lowest exposed
card always acts first on the initial betting round, but the highest exposed
hand acts first thereafter.
Since there’s no guarantee that the highest exposed hand on fourth street
will be the highest hand on the subsequent round, the pecking order can
very from one betting round to another.
Subsequent betting rounds
If you choose to continue beyond third street, your next key decision point
occurs on fifth street — when the betting limits typically double. Most Severn
Card Stud experts can tell you that a call on fifth street often commits you to
see the hand through to its conclusion. If you are still active on fifth street,
the pot is generally big enough that it pays to continue to the sometimes
bitter end. In fact, even if you can only beat a bluff on the river, you should
generally call if your opponent bets.
By learning to make good decisions on third and fifth street, you should be
able to win regularly at most low-limit games.
SeVen-Card Stud in Depth
Seven-Card Stud is a game of contrasts. Start with a big pair, or a medium pair
and a couple of high side cards, and you want to play against only a few
opponents — which you can achieve by betting, raising, or reraising to chase
out drawing hands.
If you begin with a flush or straight draw, you want plenty of opponents, and
you’d like to make your hand as inexpensively as possibly. If you’re fortunate
enough to catch a scare card or two, your opponent will have to acknowledge
the possibility that you’ve already made your hand or are likely to make it at
the earliest opportunity. If that’s the case, he may be wary of betting a big
pair into what appears to be a powerhouse holding such as a straight or
flush.
That’s the nature of Seven-Card Stud. The pairs do their betting early, trying
to make it expensive for speculative drawing hands, and those playing draws
are betting and raising later — if they’ve gotten lucky enough to complete
their hands.
53
Part I: How to Play the Games
Starting hands
Most of the time you will throw your hand away on third street. Regardless of
how eager you are to mix it up and win a pot or two, Seven-Card Stud is a
game of patience.
If you like to fish from the shoreline, daydream, meditate, or engage in other
contemplative pastimes, Seven-Card Stud is right up your alley. But if you
lack patience — or can’t learn it — this game will frustrate you to no end.
Many players lose money because they think it’s okay to play for another
round or two and see what happens. Not only does this usually result in play-
ers bleeding their money away,the very fact that they entered a pot with less
than a viable starting hand often causes them to become trapped and lose
even more money.
Before making a commitment to play a hand, you need to be aware of the
strength of your cards relative to those of your opponents, the exposed cards
visible on the table, and the number of players to act after you do. After all, the
more players who might act after you do, the more cautious you need to be.
Starting With three-of-a-kind
The best starting hand is threeof-a-kind, which is also called trips.But it’s a
rare bird, and you can expect to be dealt trips only once in 425 times. If you
play fairly long sessions, statistics show that you’ll be dealt trips every two
days or so. While it’s possible for you to be dfcalt a lower set of trips than
your opponent, the odds against this are very long, and if you are dealt trips,
you can assume that you are in the lead.
You might win even if you don’t improve at all. While you probably won’t
make a flush or a straight if you start with three-of-a-kind, the odds against
improving are only about 1.5-to-l. When you do improve, it’s probably going
to be a full house or four-of-a-kind, and at that point you will be heavily
favored to win the pot.
With trips, you will undoubtedly see the hand through to the river, unless it
becomes obvious that you are beaten. That, however, is a rarity.
Since you’ll be dealt trips once in a blue moon, it’s frustrating to raise, knock
out all your opponents, and win only the antes.Since you are undoubtedly in
the lead whenever you are dealt trips, you can afford to call and give your
opponents a ray of hope on the next betting round.
The downside, of course, is that one of your opponents will catch precisely
the card he needs to stay in the hunt and beat you with a straight or flush if
Chapter 3: Seven-Card Stud
you’re not lucky enough to improve. When you have trips, you are hoping
that one of your opponents will raise before it is your turn to act. Then you
can reraise, which should knock out most of the drawing hands.
Most of the time the pot is raised on third street, the player doing the raising
either has a big pair, or a more modest pair with a king or an ace for a side
card. But your trips are far ahead of his hand. After all, he is raising to elimi-
nate the drawing hands and hoping to make two pair in order to capture the
pot. Little does he know that you are already ahead of him, never mind the
fact that you also have ample opportunity to improve.
Your opponent will probably call your reraise, and call you all the way to the
river especially if he makes two pair. Here’s what usually happens. In the
process of winning the pot, you earn three small bets on third street, another '
on fourth street, and double-sized bets on fifth, sixth, and seventh streets. If
you are playing $10—$20, you will show a profit of $100 plus the bring-in and
the antes. If you’ve trapped an additional caller or two who wind up folding
their hand on fifth street, your profit will exceed $150.
Biq pairs
A big pair (10s or higher) is usually playable and generally warrants raising.
Your goal in raising is to thin the field and make it too expensive for drawing
hands to continue playing. A single high pair is favored against one opponent
who has a straight or a flush draw. Against two or more draws, however, you
are an underdog.
BE#
It’s always better to have a buried pair ( both cards hidden) than to have one
of the cards that comprise your pair hidden and the other exposed. There are
a number of reasons for this. For one thing, it’s deceptive. If your opponent
cannot see your pair — or even see part of it — it will be difficult for him to
assess the strength of your hand.
If fourth street were to pair your exposed card and you come out swinging,
your opponent would be apprehensive about your having three-of-a-kind.
This might constrain his aggressiveness and limit the amount you can win.
But if your pair is buried, and fourth street gives you trips, no one has a clue
about the strength of your hand, and they won’t until you’ve trapped them
for a raise or two.
Big pairs play best against one or two opponents and can sometimes win
without improvement. But you’re really hoping to make at least two pair. If
you are up against one or two opponents, your two pair will probably be the
winning hand.

Part I: How to Play the Games
Having said that, a word of caution is in order. It is critically important not to
take your pair against a bigger pair, unless you have live side cards that are
bigger than your opponent’s probable pair. For example, if you were dealt
J^Av/J*, and your opponent’s door card is Q*, her most likely hand is a pair
of queens if she continues on in the hand. (The slash mark indicates that the
two cards to the left of the slash were dealt to the player face down. The card
to the right of the slash was dealt face up.)
As long as your ace is live, you can play against the opponent. For one thing,
she might not have a pair of queens. She might have a pair of buried 9s, in
which case you are already in the lead. Even if she does have queens, you
could catch an ace or another jack, or even a king. An ace gives you two pair
that’s presumably bigger than your opponent’s hand, while trip jacks puts
you firmly in the lead.
Even catching a live king on fourth street can help you. It offers another way
to make two pair that is bigger than your opponent. You may be behind at
this point, but you still have a number of ways to win.
Smalt or medium pairs
Whether you have a pair of deuces or a bigger pair is not nearly as important
as whether your side cards are higher in rank than your opponent’s pair. If
you hold big, live side cards along with a small pair, your chances of winning
are really a function of pairing one of those side cards — and aces up beats
queens up, regardless of the rank of your second pair.
Small or medium pairs usually find themselves swimming upstream and need
to pair one of those big side cards in order to win. While a single pair of aces
or kings can win a hand of stud, particularly when it’s heads-up, winning with
a pair of deuces — or any other small pair, for that matter — is just this side
of miraculous; it doesn’t happen very often.
Playing a draw)
If you have been dealt three cards of the same suit or three cards that are in
sequence, the first order of business is to see if the cards you need are avail-
able. (Carefully check out your opponent’s exposed cards to see if any of the
cards you need are already out.) If the cards you need are not already taken,
you can usually go ahead and take another card off the deck.
Chapter 3: Seven-Card Stud
If you see that your opponents have more than two of your suit or three of
the cards that can make a straight, you really shouldn’t keep playing. If your
cards are live and you can see another card inexpensively, however, go ahead
and do so. You might get lucky and catch a fourth card of your suit, or you
could pair one of your big cards and have a couple of ways to win. Your flush
could get back on track if the fifth card is suited, or you could improve to
three-of-a-kind or two big pair.
Drawing hands can be seductive because they offer the promise of improving
to very large hands. Skilled players are not easily seduced, however, and are
armed with the discipline required to know when to release a drawing hand
and wait for a better opportunity to invest their money.
Beyond third street
Fourth street is fairly routine. You are hoping your hand improves and that
your opponents don’t catch the cards you need, or a card that appears to
better their own hand.
When an opponent pairs his exposed third street card, he may well have
made three-of-a-kind. When this happens, and you have not appreciably
improved, it’s usually a signal to release your hand.
Fifth street is the next major decision point. This is when betting limits typi-
cally double. If you pay for a card on fifth street, you’ll generally see the hand
through until the river, unless it becomes obvious that you are beaten on
board. It’s not uncommon for any number of players to call on third street
and again on fourth. But when fifth street rolls around, there are usually only
two or three players in the hand.
Often it’s the classic confrontation of a big pair — or two pair — against a
straight or flush draw. Regardless of what kind of confrontation seems to be
brewing, unless you have a big hand or big draw, you will probably throw
away many of your once-promising hands on fifth street.
In fact, if you throw away too many hands on sixth street, you can be sure
that you are making a mistake on both fifth and sixth street.
BE*
If you are fortunate enough to make what you consider to be the best hand
on sixth street, go ahead and bet — or raise if someone else has bet first.
Remember, most players will see the hand through to the river once they call
on fifth street. When you have a big hand, these later betting rounds are the
time to bet or raise. After all, good hands don’t come around all that often.
When you have one, you want to make as much money as you can.

Part I:How to Play the Games
When all the cants have been dealt
If you’ve seen the hand through to the river, you should consider calling any
bet as long as you have a hand that can beat a bluff (assuming you are heads
up — playing against just one other player). Pots can get quite large in Seven-
Card Stud. If your opponent was on a draw and missed, the only way for her
to win the pot is to bluff and hope you throw away your hand. Your opponent
doesn’t need to succeed at this too often to make the strategy correct. After
all, she is risking only one bet to try to capture an entire pot full of bets.
Most of the time you’ll make a crying call (a call made by a person who is
sure he will lose) and your opponent will show you a better hand. But every
now and then you’ll catch her speeding (bluffing), and win the pot. And you
don’t have to snap off a bluff all that often for it to be the play of choice.
Seven-Card Stud is a complex game with a number of strategic elements. Take

M exas Hold’em is the most popular game played in casino poker rooms.
m Although playing expertly requires a great deal of skill, Hold’em is easily
learned and deceptively simple. It is a subtle and complex game, typically
played with nine or ten players to a table and is a faster, more action-filled
game than Stud or most other games. Texas Hold’em is also the fastest grow-
ing poker game in the world, and it is the game used to determine the world
champion at the World Series of Poker.
Basic Rules
In Hold’em, two cards are dealt face down to each player, and a round of bet-
ting takes place. On the first round, players may either call or raise the blind
bet, or they must fold their hand. Most casinos allow a bet and three or four
raises per betting round, with one exception:When only two players contest
the pot there is no limit on the number of raises permitted.
When the first round of betting is complete, three communal cards, called the
flop, are turned face up in the center of the table. That’s followed by another
round of betting. On this and each succeeding round, players may check if no
one has bet when it is their turn to act. If there is no bet,a player may check
or bet. If there is a bet, players may fold, call, raise, or reraise.
00
Part I: Howto Play the Games
A fourth communal card — called the turn — is then exposed. Another round
of betting takes place. Then the fifth and final community card — known as
the river— is placed in the center of the table followed by the last round of
betting. The best five-card poker hand using any combination of a player’s
two private cards and the five communal cards is the winner.
That’s all there is to the play of the game. Yet within this simplicity lies an ele-
gance and sophistication that makes Texas Hold’em the most popular form of
poker in the world.
Blind Bets
Before cards are dealt, the first two players to the left of the dealer position
are required to post blind bets, which are used instead of antes to stimulate
action. (Those two players post their bets before they see any cards and,
thus, are “blind.”)
In a $10—$20 Hold’em game, blinds are usually $5 and $10. Each blind is con-
sidered live. Because blinds represent a forced, first bet, the blind bettors
can raise (but only on the first round) once the betting has gone around the
table and it is their turn to act again.
Unlike Stud, where position is determined by each player’s exposed cards,
referred to as his board, the player with the dealer button (see the section
“Position, position, and position,” later in this chapter) acts last in every
round of betting— with the exception of the first one.
Hold’em in General
While Hold’em is exciting, exhilarating, and enjoyable, you should know
something before diving in and plunking your money down — even if you are
playing the lowest-limit game in the house. This section offers a few of those
somethings we wish we had known when first making the transition from
Seven-Card Stud to Texas Hold’em.
Hold’em only looks like Stud; it plays
differently
With a total of seven cards, some of which are turned face up and others
down, Hold’em bears a resemblance to Seven-Card Stud. But this furtive simi-
larity is only a “tastes like chicken” analogy.
Chapter 4:Texas Hold'em
\NG/
r
One major difference is that 71 percent of your hand is defined on the flop. As
a result, your best values in Hold’em are found up front; you get to see 71 per-
cent of your hand for a single round of betting.
Staying for the turn and river demands that you either have a strong hand, a
draw to a potentially winning hand, or good reason to believe that betting on a
future round may cause your opponents to fold. Because there are only two
additional cards dealt after the flop, along with the fact that the five communal
cards play in everyone’s hand, there are fewer draw-outs in Hold’em than Stud.
(A draw-out happens when you draw cards that make your hand better than
your opponent’s.)
Also, because Hold’em uses exposed communal cards in the center of the
table that combine with two hidden cards in each player’s hand to form the
best poker hand, it is more difficult for an opponent to draw-out on you than
in Stud poker. For example, if you were dealt a pair of jacks and your opponent
held a pair of 9s, the presence of a pair of 5s among the communal cards gives
each of you two pair. But you still have the best hand. Unless one of those 5s
helped an opponent complete a straight, the only player helped by that pair of
5s would be an opponent fortunate enough to have another 5 in his hand.
The first two cards are critical
4
You’ll frequently hear players say that any two cards can win. While that’s
true as far as it goes, it doesn’t go far enough. The whole truth is this: While
any two cards can win, they won’t win enough to warrant playing them. Like
all forms of poker, you need starting standards.Players who lack starting stan-
dards take the worst of it far too often. See Chapter 2 for more detail about
starting standards.
Position, position, and position
There’s an old real estate bromide that says the three most important fea-
tures of any property are location, location, and location. In Hold’em, the
important features are position, position, and position. Where your place is
at the table (your position) is so important that some two-card holdings,
which can’t be played profitably from early position, are cards you might
raise with when you’re last to act.
In a typical nine-handed game, early position includes both blinds and the two
players to their left. The fifth, sixth, and seventh players to act are in middle
position, and the eighth and ninth players are in late position.
Because casino games are dealt by house dealers, a small disk — called a
puck, a buck, or, most commonly, a button — is used as a marker to indicate
the player in the dealer position. That player is always last to act. The button
62
Part I:How to Play the Games
rotates clockwise around the table with each hand that’s dealt. The expres-
sion “passing the buck” does not refer to dollar bills, but to poker. And
President Harry S. Truman, an avid poker player himself, had a sign on his
desk in the White House that read, “The buck stops here.”
Beyond the flop
As a general rule, you shouldn’t continue beyond the flop without a strong
pair and a decent side-card (or kicker), or a straight or flush draw with at least
two opponents to ensure that the pot is big enough to make it worthwhile.
Because of the communal cards, players frequently have the same hand, with
the exception of their unpaired side card, or kicker. When that happens, it’s
the rank of each player’s kicker that determines who wins the pot in ques-
tion. That’s why most Hold’em players love to be dealt A-K (or “Big Slick,” as
players call it). If the flop contains either an ace or a king, the player holding
Big Slick will have the top pair with the best possible kicker.
Game texture — the relative aggressiveness or passivity exhibited by the
players— is also important in determining whether to call that bet or raise.
But a feeling for the game’s texture and how it should influence your play can
be obtained only from live game experience. In the absence of that experi-
ence, err on the side of caution. It costs less.
Success at Hold’em demands that you be patient, pay close attention to posi-
tion, and take comfort in the knowledge that good hands are run down less
often than the best Seven-Card Stud hands.
The flop should fit your hand
No matter how sweet your first two cards may appear, an unfavorable flop
can render them nearly worthless. A key concept is that the flop must fit your
hand. We call this concept “fit or fold.” If the flop doesn’t strengthen your
hand or offer a draw to a very strong hand, you should usually release it.
J
Suppose you called on the first round of betting with A*J +, and the flop is
Q45^3*. YOU don’t have a strong hand at this point. What you do have, how-
ever, is a hand with extremely strong potential. If another diamond falls on
the turn or the river, you’ll make a flush. Not any flush, mind you, but the
best possible flush, since your ace precludes any of your opponents from
making a higher one.
Even if you don’t make a flush but were to catch a jack or an ace instead, that
may be enough to win the pot.
Chapter 4: Texas Hold'em
Hotd’em in Depth
Combinations of poker hands number literally in the millions; in Hold’em, how-
ever, there are only 169 different two-card starting combinations. That number,
of course, assumes that a hand like K>Q4 is the equivalent of K*Q*. If three
diamonds were to appear on the flop, the!£ ()
would be significantly more
valuable than K*Q*. But the future can neither be predicted nor controlled,
and these two hands have identical value before the flop.
Each one of these 169 unique starting combinations fits into one of only five
categories:
u* Pairs
v* Connecting cards
I** Gapped cards
^ Suited connectors
^ Suited gapped cards
That’s it. Five categories. That’s all you have to worry about.
If you are not dealt a pair, your cards will be either suited (of the same suit)
or unsuited. They also can be connected (consecutive) or gapped (uncon-
nected). Examples of connectors are K-Q, 8-7, and 4-3. Unconnected cards
might be one-, two-, three-gapped, or more, and would include hands like K-J
(one gap, with Q missing), 9-6 (two gap, missing 7-8), or 9-3 (five gap, missing
4-5-6-7-8).
Small yaps make more straights
Generally, the smaller the gap, the easier it is to make a straight. Suppose
that you hold 10-6. Your only straight possibility is 9-8-7. But if you hold 10-9,
you can make a straight with K-Q-J, Q-J-8, J-8-7, and 8-7-6.
Every rule has exceptions. A hand like A-K can make only one straight. It
needs to marry a Q-J-T. An A-2 is in the same boat and needs to cozy up to a
5-4-3. Although connected, each of these holdings can make only one straight
because they reside at the end of the spectrum.
Other exceptions include a K-Q, which can make a straight only two ways, by
connecting with A-J-10 or J-10-9; and 3-2 is in a similar fix. The only other lim-
ited connectors are — yes, you guessed it — Q-J and 4-3. These two holdings
can each make three straights. The Q-J needs A-K-10, K-10-9, or 10-9-8. It can’t
make that fourth straight because there is no room above an ace. The 4-3 is
^
PartI: How to Play the Games
similarly constrained because there is no room below the ace. But any other
connectors can make straights four ways, and that’s a big advantage over
one-, two-, or three-gapped cards.
Unless you are fortunate enough to wrap four cards around one of your four-
gappers, there’s no way these cards can make a straight. But don’t worry
about that. If you take our advice, you will seldom, if ever, play hands that are
four-gapped or worse unless they are suited — and then only under very
favorable circumstances.
Gapped cards
Gapped cards, in general, are not as valuable as connectors because of their
difficulty in completing straights. But if you were to make a flush there’s no
need to be concerned about the gap. After all, a flush made with Av6v is just
as good as an AvKv flush. But A-K is more valuable for other reasons.
Suppose that flush never comes. You can make a straight with A-K; you can’t
with A-6 (unless four cards come on the board to help your straight).
You might also win if you catch either an ace or a king. If an ace flops, you’ll
have made a pair of aces with a 6 side-card, or kicker, and could easily lose to
an opponent holding an ace with a bigger companion. But any pair you’d
make with the A-K would be the top pair with the best possible kicker.
Acting last is a big advantage
Acting later in a hand is a big advantage, so you can afford to see the flop
with weaker hands when you’re in late position. If you’re last to act, you’ve
had the advantage of knowing how many opponents are still in the pot and
seeing how each of them acted on the current round of betting. That’s a big
edge, because some starting hands play better against a large number of
opponents, while others play better against a smaller field.
In late position you’ll also know which of your adversaries are representing
strength by betting or raising. The later you act, the more information at your
disposal. And poker is a game of information — incomplete information, to be
sure, but it’s a game of information nevertheless.
Some starting hands are so strong they can be played in any position. You
don’t get these hands very often, but when you do, you are generally a
favorite from the get-go to win that pot.
Chapter 4:Texas Hold'em
The following table shows that we recommend playing any pair of 7s or
higher in early position, as well as the twelve suited and six unsuited card
combinations.

When you are the fifth, sixth, or seventh player to act, then you are in middle
position and can safely play smaller pairs like 6s and 5s. You can also add ten
additional suited hands and four more unsuited combinations to your
playable repertoire if the pot has not been raised.

In late position you have the advantage of acting last or next-to-last. As a
result, you can add a variety of hands to your arsenal. Most are bargain base-
ment specials, however, that should be played only if the pot has not been
raised. Moreover, you should be disciplined enough to release them if the
flop brings anything less than an abundant harvest of friendly cards.

If you are new to the game, have been playing indiscriminately, or have an
any-two-cards-can-win philosophy, you may believe these recommendations
are too tight. They’re not. In fact, they are somewhat loose.
A hand like K¥ 2v, while playable in late position, is a pretty sorry excuse for
a Hold’em hand. If you flop a king and there’s any appreciable action, it’s
fairly apparent that someone else has a king with a bigger kicker than yours.
If you flop a 2, you’ve guaranteed yourself the lowest pair on board. Even if
you are incredibly lucky and flop a flush, there’s no assurance that it is the
best flush. Probably the very best flop you could hope for is something like
Av2+24, which gives you three deuces with a strong kicker. You also have
three cards to a flush, and while the odds against catching two more hearts
are long indeed, it is an additional way to win. Players call this a backdoor
draw. More importantly, an ace on the board guarantees a call or two from
any opponents holding an ace in their hand.
Still, Kv2v and a lot of the other playable hands in late position are vulnera-
ble from any number of directions, and it takes some degree of skill to navi-
gate your way through the murky waters of a Hold’em pot in a rickety canoe
like this one.

’be Art of Raising
Raising adds spice to the game of poker and money to the pot. Raising is an
act of aggression and causes everyone to sit up and take notice. When there’s
a raise or reraise, the level of excitement escalates. Sometimes you’ll be
raised, and sometimes you’ll do the raising. Regardless of whether you’re the
raiser or raisee, it’s time to sit up and take notice whenever a raise is made.
you1i/e been raised
If the pot has been raised before it is your turn to act, you must tighten up
significantly on the hands you play. Savvy players might raise with almost
anything in late position if no one except the blinds are in the pot, but if a
player raises from early position, give him credit for a good hand, and throw
away all but the very strongest of hands.

Remember that you need a stronger hand to call a raise than to initiate one.

a strong hand, and you should generally only call if you believe your hand to
be even stronger.
When someone's raised after you'Oe called
When an opponent raises after you’ve called, you are essentially committed to
calling his raise, seeing the flop, and then deciding on the best course of action.
6$
Part I: How to Play the Games
But when you call only to find yourself raised and raised again by a third
opponent you should seriously consider throwing your hand away unless it i
extremely strong.
Suppose that you called with a hand like 10v9v. Just because this hand may
be playable in a tame game doesn’t mean you must play it. In a game with fre
quent raising it may not a playable hand because it is speculative and best
played inexpensively from late position. The ideal way to play this hand is
from late position, with a large number of opponents, in a pot that has not
been raised. Now this hand is worth a shot. You can always throw it away
whenever the flop is unfavorable.
When should you raise7
Hold’em is a game that requires aggressive play as well as selectivity. You
can’t win in the long run by passively calling. You have to initiate your share
of raises too; and here are some raising hands:
v0 You can always raise with a pair of aces, kings, queens, jacks and 10s. In
fact, if someone has raised before it’s your turn to act and you have a
pair of aces, kings, and queens in your hand, go ahead and reraise. You
probably have the best hand anyway. Reraising protects your hand by
thinning the field, thus minimizing the chances of anyone getting lucky
on the flop.
You can also raise if you’re holding a suited ace with a king, queen, or
jack, or a suited king with a queen. If your cards are unsuited, you can
raise if you’re holding an ace with a king or queen, or a king with a
queen.
v* If you are in late position and no one has called the blinds, you can usu-
ally safely raise with any pair, an ace with any kicker, and a king with a
queen, jack, 10, or 9. When you raise in this situation, you’re really
hoping that the blinds— which are, after all, random hands— will fold.
But even if they play, your ace or king is likely to be the best hand if no
one improves.
Playing the Flop
Defining moments are crystallized instances in time, forever frozen in
memory, imprinted into consciousness, never to be forgotten. Like Neil
Armstrong walking on the moon, and the first home run you hit in Little
League, these magical moments shape the way you perceive and value the
world around you.
Chapter 4:Texas Hold'em 69
Hold’em also has its defining moment, and it’s the flop. (See the section
“Basic Rules” for details about the flop.) Unlike Seven-Card Stud, where cards
that follow your initial holding are parceled out one by one with rounds of
betting interspersed, when you see the flop in Hold’em, you’re looking at five-
sevenths of your hand. That’s 71 percent of your hand, and the cost is only a
single round of betting.
The implications of this situation should be abundantly clear: If the flop does

not fit your hand, be done with it. Playing long-shot holdings after the flop is

I
a sure way to lose money. After the flop, the relationship between the betting
mj\J
and cards-to-come is reversed. Now you’re looking at spending 83 percent of
the potential cost of a hand for the remaining 29 percent of the cards!
Fit or fold
Fit or fold. That’s what you have to decide on when playing the flop. Fit can

You hold a big pair before the flop.
If you don’t improve to a big hand or a draw with a nice potential payoff, then
get out (fold)— and do it now.
Flops you're yoiny to tof/e, flops to fold on
While you’re not going to like the flop most of the time, there are those rare
instances when it fits like a custom-made suit. When you’re lucky enough to
flop a straight flush, four-of-a-kind, a full house, or the nut flush, your major
worry is not whether you’ll win, but how much money you can extract from
your opponents.
Your first order of business is to examine the texture of the flop. Based on the
betting pattern prior to the flop, try to determine if one or more of your
opponents has made a hand or has a draw to a hand that would be second-
best to yours.
Take a look at how you can handle different types of flops:

LoVable flops
I u* Straight flush: Bet the house, the farm, and mortgage your soul. You

shouldn’t lose.
I i* Four-of-a-kind: If there are two pair on board, and you have the smaller of
the two pair, it is possible — though very unlikely— that you can lose this

hand. But if there’s only one pair on board and you have the matching
-
pair in your hand, you have the practical nuts. You can lose only to a
straight flush or royal flush, unless a bigger communal comes along and
someone else has a bigger four-of-a-kind. But don’t worry; you’ll seldom, if
ever, lose with hands like these.
t0* Full house: A terrific hand, but you have to examine the board to make
sure that yours is the best possible full house before you bet the farm.
;
But don’t be afraid to raise with a full house; it’s probably a winner.
I 00 Nut flush: If you have an ace-high flush when all the cards have been

dealt, and no pair is on the board — which means that a full house or
four-of-a-kind is not possible — you’ve got the best possible hand. Just
keep betting or raising and don’t stop.
I i00 Nut straight: If you have the highest possible straight, and there’s no

banqerous f(ops
^ Kicker trouble: Even if you flop top pair, your hand is only as strong as
your kicker. It’s a lot nicer to make top pair with an ace kicker than a
weaker one.
v* Suited board: Flops where all the cards are of the same suit or are
sequenced, like 10-9-8 are dangerous.Someone may already have made a
straight or a flush, and even if you’ve been lucky enough to flop a set,
you are heading uphill and may have to see the board pair — giving you
a full house— in order to win. With top pair, or even two pair, discretion
is usually the better part of valor with suited or sequenced flops.
Overcards
An overcard is a card higher than the highest card on the board.Should you
play overcards or not? Many of your opponents will routinely call with over-
cards. Suppose you call before the flop with K-J, you’re up against three
opponents, and the flop is 8-6-3 of mixed suits. What should you do if someone
bets? Do you call, hoping the next card off the deck is a king or jack— one of
the six remaining cards in the deck that presumably gives you a winning
hand? Or are you better off folding, and waiting for a flop that fits your hand?
Making a good decision involves knowing your opponents and the hands they
are likely to play. Then examine the flop. Is it the kind of flop that will tend to
hit one or more players? Or is it so ragged that it’s unlikely any of your oppo-
nents are holding cards the flop would have paired? You should also be
aware of how many opponents you’re facing. The more opponents, the more
likely the flop will hit at least one of them.
If you’re unsure what to do, err on the side of caution until you gain enough
playing experience to feel comfortable in these situations.
Flopping a draw
When you flop a four-flush or a four-straight, you’ll have to decide whether to
continue with your draw. Here’s how to make that decision:
^
You’ll need enough opponents so that the size of the pot offsets the mathe-
matical odds against completing your hand. How many opponents do you
need? If you’re facing three or more, it’s typically worthwhile to draw If
you’re holding two large cards, like A-Q, you’re probably favored against any
lone opponent regardless of whether you make your hand. You might also
win by pairing either of your cards on the turn or river. Sometimes just two
big cards will be sufficient to win in a showdown.

against making your hand.
Multiu>ay possibilities
You'll occasionally flop hands that offer a plethora of possibilities. Assume
you hold 8v 7v , and the flop is 7*6*5v. You’ve flopped top pair, as well as a
straight draw, and you have backdoor flush potential (see the “Starting
Hands” section for more about backdoor draws).
When you flop a hand with more than one way to win, your hand is stronger
than any of its individual components. Your pair may win by itself. Your hand
could improve to trips or two pair. You might make a straight on the turn or
river, or make a flush if the next two cards are both hearts.
Here’s another example: You hold A+J+ and the flop is Av9*4*. Chances are
you hold the best hand and are favored to win even if your hand does not
improve. You may also get lucky and turn your good hand into a great one. A
jack gives you two pair, and ace gives you three aces, and any club makes the
nut flush.
With a hand this promising you want action. Get more money into the pot by
betting or raising. And if you think one of your opponents is going to bet, you
can try for a checkraise.
Chapter 4:Texas Hold'em
Playing the Turn
The turn card is the fourth card dealt face up and is common to everyone’s
hand. Some poker pundits have suggested that the turn plays itself. While
you can’t play the turn on autopilot, you shouldn’t get yourself into too much
trouble unless you’ve already made the mistake of seeing the turn when you
shouldn’t have. If that’s the case, you’ve already thrown good money after bad.
Much of the time you won’t even see the turn. You’ll have thrown away most
of your hands before the flop and released others once you saw that the flop
didn’t fit. If there’s no logical reason to be in the pot by the turn, you should
have folded. It’s very easy to squander your bankroll one bet at a time. Poor
players do just that, calling one more bet and then another. While calling any
one bet may be insignificant by itself, collectively it can break you.
If you’ve made it to the turn you should be holding a good hand, a promising
draw, or believe your bluff can pick up the pot.

What to do uthen you improve
on the turn
Your hand can improve on the turn in one of two ways. The first, and best,
happens whenever the turn card improves your hand. But you’ll also benefit if
you had a good hand going in, and the turn — while not helping your hand —
did nothing to improve your opponent’s either.
If you have top two pair on the turn and an opponent bets, you should usu-
ally raise. If you are in late position and none of your opponents have acted,
go ahead and bet. If you’re in early position, check with the intention of rais-
ing if you are fairly certain orve of your opponents will bet. If you think your
opponents might also check, forget about trying to checkraise and come out
betting.
If you have the best hand, betting gets more money into the pot and makes it
expensive for anyone to draw-out on you. But it’s not a totally risk-free strat-
egy. If your opponent has made a set or turned a straight, you can count on
being raised or reraised.
What to do uthen you don't improve
on the turn
It’s unfortunate, but true: Most of the time the turn card will not help you.
What’s a player to do?
If you have an open-ended straight or flush draw and you’re up against two or
more opponents, you should usually call a bet on the turn. However, if the
board is paired and there’s a bet and raise in front of you, be wary. You may
be facing a full house. If you are, you’re drawing dead. (See the section about
slang in Chapter 15 for more about drawing dead.)
You may be facing a set or two pair. Once again, knowing your opponents will
help you determine what they might be holding. If you’re up against someone
who never raises a three-suited board unless he can beat that probable flush,
release your hand.
If the turn didn’t help and there is a bet in front of you, not only has the cost
gone up, but the number of future betting rounds has decreased. You have
less opportunity to punish your opponents if you make your hand. Moreover,
many of them will probably fold on the turn too, leaving you with fewer oppo-
nents to punish, if indeed you were to get lucky on the river.

Chapter 4: Texas Hold'em
Should you continue utith a drau?)
Flopping four-flush or an open-ended straight draw is a common situation. If
it’s relatively inexpensive, you’ll invariably stay for the turn card — particu-
larly when you’re certain yours will be the best hand if you make it. But most
of the time the turn card will not help you. Players call that a stiff After all, if
you’ve flopped a four-flush there are only nine remaining cards of your suit in
the deck.
Even if you don’t complete your straight or flush on the turn, it usually pays
to see the river card in hopes that deliverance is at hand, and you can reap
the rewards.
Should you checkmise or come
out bettiny )
Suppose you were dealt Q-J, flopped an open ended straight draw when
10-9-5 showed up on board and made your hand when an 8appeared on the
turn. If you’re really lucky, one of your opponents holds 7-6, or J-7 and made a
smaller straight. You’d love to see that, since they’d be drawing dead, absent
flush possibilities.
If you try for a checkraise and your opponents all check behind you, you’ve
cost yourself some money. Should you bet, hoping to get some more money
into the pot? Or are you better off checkraising and trying for a bigger
payday, bearing in mind you may not get any money into the pot at all if your
opponents also check.
It’s time to put on your Sherlock Holmes hat and do some detective work by
reconstructing the play of the hand. Was there a lot of action before the flop,
suggesting that your opponents held big hands or big pairs? Did they raise on
the flop, suggesting they might have been trying to force any straight draws
to fold? Or did they just check and call, suggesting that they were also on the
come, and have now made their hand — albeit a lesser one than yours.
But an opponent holding a single big pair might also check, since the turn
showed straight possibilities. If you think this is the case, you’re better off
leading with a bet, since she may call, but would throw her hand away if she
were the bettor and you raised.
If your opponent was also drawing, you might want to check, hoping she will
try to steal the pot by bluffing. Another possibility is that she made a smaller
straight than yours, and will bet from late position. If that’s the case, you can
raise with the assurance she will not lay her hand down— even if she sus-
pects you have the nut straight.
Part I:How to Play the Games
cjABftf
This is a case where recalling the play of the hand is more important than
knowing the tendencies of your opponents. If you can deduce what kind of
hand — or hands — your opponents are likely to hold, you can decide
whether to come out betting or try for a checkraise. Remember, unless you
think your opponent will bet and call your raise, betting is the preferred
course of action.
Bluffing on the turn
Suppose that you raised with A-K before the flop and then bet into two oppo-
nents when the flop was J-7-3. You don’t suspect any strength, and know your
opponents are solid enough players to release a hand when they think
they’re beaten.
Because your opponents have to consider the possibility that you’re holding
an overpair or a jack with a good kicker, it will be difficult for them to call
with anything less than a hand like J-8. Of course, if your opponents are call-
ing stations, they’ll call with almost anything, and you’ll have to become
adept enough at knowing their proclivities, so you don’t try to bluff someone
who never releases a hand.
A good player also understands that you might be betting a hand like A-K. But
he may not call even if he holds a hand like 8-7, since he can’t be certain
about what you have, and could be beaten if his inclination about your bluff
is wrong.

Chapter 4:Texas Hold'em
Your bet may cause an opponent to lay down the best hand. Even if he calls,
the river could bring an ace or king and win the pot for you. But if you bet
and are raised, throw your hand away. Sure, someone may be making a move
on you. But it doesn’t happen frequently enough to worry about, particularly
in low-limit games. Most of the time you’ll be beaten when you’re raised in
this situation.
Playing the Ki(/er
If you’re still contesting the pot while awaiting that last card on the board
(the river card), you should have a strong hand, or a draw to what you
believe will be the best hand if you make it. If you’re playing with reasonably
prudent opponents, what may have begun as a confrontation between five or
six will probably be reduced to two— or perhaps three of you — once all the
board cards have been exposed.
Realized Versus potential Value
Prior to the last card, many strategic considerations are predicated on your
chances for subsequent improvement. You could, for example, bet a hand
composed of a pair and four flush. Taken together, that pair, coupled with its
potential for a flush as well as the possibilities of improving to two pair or
trips, made it worth playing. And its worth was made up of both realized and
potential value.
Once the river card is exposed, your hand no longer has any potential value.
Its value is fully realized — for better or worse. If that flush draw never mate-
rialized, you’re left with one pair, and it may not be enough to win the pot.
More importantly, your strategic thinking has to change too. You have no
remaining potential upon which to base decisions.
What do l do When I make my draw7
g§
Many Hold’em newbies automatically check a good flush from early position,
hoping to checkraise, thereby trapping their opponents for an additional
bet. Others will always bet. These are two very different strategies. Which is
correct?
Here’s part one of the general rule on checkraising: Do it when you believe
you will have the best hand most of the time you are called.
PartI: How to Play the Games
Part two of the general rule on checkraising states that you need to be cer-
tain your opponent will bet if you check. It’s no fun to check a big hand only
to have your opponents check behind you, especially when you know they
would have called if you had bet.
If you are not certain you’ll hold the best hand if you are called, or you aren’t
sure one of your opponents will bet if you check, do not checkraise.
Top pair on the ritfer
An enduring dilemma is what to do when you’re holding top pair against one
or two opponents and all thecards are out. Now you have to decide whether
to check or bet, or if your opponent acts first, whether to call, fold, or raise.
If you’re observant, you will have noticed that some opponents will almost
always bet top pair on the river, unless there is a strong threat of a flush or
straight. Others seldom bet one pair, even when the board is not threatening.
Most, however, fall somewhere in between. This is a judgment call. There is
no formula to help you determine the best course of action, but there are
some things you can do to clarify your decision.
Suppose you are first to act and raise before the flop with A-K. Two oppo-
nents call. You bet the flop and the turn. Now the board shows A-(H-7-9 of
mixed suits. All the cards are out, no one has folded, and it’s your turn to act.
Should you bet or check?
You’ll beat any pair, but lose to any two pair. Unless one of your callers held a
pocket pair of 9s and made a set on the river, you can probably dismiss the
notion that there is a set out against you. If one of your opponents either
flopped or turned a set, he would have raised on the turn — when the betting
limits doubled.
Your real concern, of course, is whether one of your opponents holds two
pair. If an opponent held A-Q she probably would have raised before the flop,
called on the flop and raised your bet on the turn. An opponent holding A-7,
A-4, Q-4 or Q-7 would probably have raised on the turn.
If your opponents would raise with any two pair and call with lesser hands,
like A-8 or Q-J, you’ll want to bet. If they had made two pair on the turn, that’s
when they would have likely raised. Except for the chance that they are hold-
ing A-9, Q-9, 9-7, or 9-4, your bet on the river will elicit a call, and you’ll win.
Now imagine the same scenario, but this time your opponent is first to act. If
she bets, should you fold, call, or raise, and if she checks, should you bet?

to beat legitimate calling hands.
If your opponent is very aggressive and tends to overplay weak hands, you
can raise if you suspect she is betting a weaker hand than yours. If she is a
tight player, just call her bet. If she is a real rock who seldom, if ever, bluffs,
then throw away anything less than top pair with a very big kicker whenever
she bets on the river.
The key, of course, is to know your opponents and their tendencies. Top pair
on the river is a very common situation, and it is critically important that you
learn to play it well.
When the Pot Gets Big
Pots sometimes grow quite large, particularly when there has been a raise
before the flop. This can tie a lot of players to the pot, and if the flop provides
a flush- or straight-draw to your opponents, you can be certain they’ll be
there to the end.
If the straight or flush cards fail to come, a bet will usually drop any oppo-
nents who were drawing. Often there are only two or three opponents con-
testing a very large pot on the river.
You might be in there with second pair, or perhaps top pair with a marginal
kicker, and your opponent comes out betting. You’re holding a hand you’d
throw away if the pot were small, but with all that money in it, what should
you do? Suppose you’re playing in a $3-$6 Hold’em game and the pot is $90
SO
Part I: How to Play the Games
by the time you reach the river. If your opponent bets, the pot now contains
$96, and is offering you 16-to-l on your money. If you call and are beaten, the
cost is only an additional $6.
If you throw your hand away and your opponent was bluffing, you made a $96
mistake.
'
The answer should be obvious. If you believe this to be a situation in which
your opponent would bluff more than one time in 16, go ahead and call. Only
if you are sure your opponent would never bluff, you can comfortably throw
your hand away.
iTSsi
You’re always better off committing the small error of calling with a losing
hand, than the catastrophic brror of folding a winner. In the situation cited
above, even if your opponent would only bluff one time in ten, you are far
better off calling than folding.
If you were to call ten times, you’d lose $6 on nine occasions, for a loss of $54.
On the tenth occasion, you’d win a $96 pot, for a net profit of $42. If you
divide that $42 profit by each of the ten times you called, your decision to
call is worth $4.20 each time you make it — regardless of whether you win
that particular pot.
If you are second to act and think there’s some chance you have the best
hand, even if you don’t consider yourself the favorite, you may want to raise
if your opponent comes out betting. By doing this, you may get the third
opponent to lay down his hand. If your first opponent was betting a fairly
weak hand in hopes that you might fold, he, in turn, may now fold if he sus-
pects you’re holding a powerhouse. A play like this also adds some deception
to your game. But like all deceptive plays, you have to use it sparingly.

even-Card Stud 8-or-Better, High-Low Split — we’ll call it Seven-Stud/8 for
convenience sake — is a game that continues to grow in popularity.
Games where the high and low hands divvy up the money often have very
large pots. Since the pot is divided in half much of the time, many players
who wouldn’t ordinarily be in the hand if it was plain, old, garden-variety
Seven-Card Stud (where there’s one winner only: the best high hand) are in
there slugging it out.
tf you’ve Never Played
Seven-Stud/8 Before
In Seven-Stud/8, the best high hand and the best low hand split the pot,
assuming, of course, that there is a low hand. There’s always a high hand, but
in order to have a low hand, a player must have five unpaired cards in his
hand with the rank of 8 or lower. That’s called an 8-qualifier.
$2
Part I: How to Play the Games
One could probably play with a 9-qualifier, or any other qualifier for that
matter, but the game is well balanced with an 8-qualifier. Each player receives
seven cards that can be used in any combination to make hands. In other
words, you can make a low hand and a high one, and perhaps win the high
and low portions of the pot. Winning both portions of the pot is called scoop-
ing— you use different combinations of the seven cards in your hands (or
even the same five cards) to form two distinctly different five-card holdings.
For example, if your seven cards were A4J 494745 4 4*2*, you’re high hand
would be an ace-high flush, composed ofA+J*94745+. Your low hand would
be called a 7-low, and would be made up of 74544A2*A 4.
4)
Now you’ve already discovered something very important about Seven-
Stud/8: You can use aces as Both the highest and lowest card in the deck.
When you’re dealt an ace, it’s like receiving two cards for the price of one,
and that’s an important concept to remember.
m
Seven-Stud/8 has five rounds of betting, just like it’s high-hand-only cousin.
This creates large pots on occasion because some players are trying to make
a high hand, while others are hoping to make the best low hand. Skilled play-
ers need to be alert and be aware of the cards that are live, as well as those
that have been folded. (For more on live cards, see the section “The impor-
tance of live cards” in this chapter.)

Chapter 5: Seven-Card Stud Eight-or-Better, High-Low Split (Seven-Stud/8)
The goal of every high-low split game is to try to scoop the pot and win all
the money In the absence of that, you should always try to be the only player
heading in your direction, regardless of whether that is high or low.
Antes, the Deal, and the
Betting Structure
Before the cards are dealt each player posts an ante, which is a fraction of a
bet — just like in traditional Seven-Card Stud. Antes seed the pot and stimu-
late action.
Players are then dealt two cards face down, along with one face up. The
lowest exposed card is required to make a small bet of a predetermined
denomination. This bet (and the person making that bet) is called the bring-
in. If two or more players have an exposed card of the same rank, then the
alphabetical order of suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades) determines
the bring-in.
If Ron has the 24 and Amber the 2*, Amber would be required to bring it in
based on the order of suits. While an ace can be used as both a high card and
a low card in this game, for purposes of establishing the bring-in, an ace is
considered to be high, and Amber’s 24» is the lowest card in the deck.
Betting
The player to the immediate left of the bring-in has three options. He may
fold his hand, call the bring-in, or raise to a full bet. In a $20-$40 game, the
antes are usually $3 and the bring-in is $5. The player to the left of the bring-
in can either fold, call the $5 bring-in bet, or raise to $20— which constitutes
a full bet.
If he folds or calls the bring-in, the player to his immediate left has the same
options. Once someone raises to a full bet, subsequent players must do one
of the following: fold, call the full bet, or raise again.
Once betting has been equalized, a second card is dealt face up, and another
round of betting ensues. This time, however, it is in increments of full bets.
The player with the highest-ranking board cards acts first.
If there are two high cards of the same rank, the order of the suit determines
who acts first. The highest suit is spades, followed by hearts, then diamonds,
and finally, clubs.
83
r
54
Part I: How to Play the Games
The first player to act may either check or bet. But unlike traditional Seven-
Card Stud, an open pair on board does not afford a player the option of
making a big bet.
Betting order
Just like Seven-Card Stud play for high, the lowest exposed card always acts
first on the initial betting round, but the highest exposed hand acts first
thereafter.
Since there’s no guarantee that the highest exposed hand on fourth street
will be the highest hand on the subsequent round, the pecking order can
very from one betting round to another. For more on betting order, see
“Position” in this section.
Raising
Most casinos allow three or four raises per betting round, except when only
two players are contesting the pot. Then there is no limit to the number of
raises permitted because either player can end the raising bar by calling her
opponent’s last bet.
Position
Betting order (who bets when) depends on the person’s place, or position, at
a table. Position is determined by the cards showing on the board and can
vary from round to round. With the exception of the first round of betting on
third street, where the lowest ranked card is required to bring it in, the high-
est hand on board acts first, and has the option of checking or betting.
The highest hand could range anywhere from four-of-a-kind, to trips, to two
pair, to a single pair, or even the highest card, if no exposed pair is present.
Double bets
Betting usually doubles on fifth street (the fifth card dealt), and those players
still contesting the pot are dealt another exposed card, followed by a round
of betting. Sixth street is the same. The last card, called seventh street or the
river, is dealt face down. At the river, active players have a hand made up of
three closed and four exposed cards. The player who acted first on sixth
street acts first on seventh street, too.
Chapter 5: Seven-Card Stud Eight-or-Better,High-Low Split (Seven-Stud/8)
ShoWdovOn
If more than one player is active after all the betting has been equalized, play-
ers turn their hands face up, making the best five-card hand — or hands—
from the seven cards they are holding. The best high hand wins half the pot,
and the best low hand, assuming there is a qualifying low hand, wins the
other half. The players don’t have to disclose which way they are going
(although some home games are played with such a declare).
In most home games where players have to declare whether they are going
high, low, or both ways, the usual rule is that if you declare in both directions
but lose in one of them, then you are ineligible to win the other half of the
pot. (In other words, you either win the whole pot or lose the whole pot.)
'
Declaration is usually done with coins. Players put one, two, or three coins
(for low, high, or both, respectively) in their hands and open their fists for a
simultaneous declaration. Declaring adds another element of strategy to the
home game. In casino games, however, there is no declaration. “Cards speak”
is the rule in public card games. (See Chapter 1 for details on cards speak.)
Having the best high hand and the best low hand in the same hand is possi-
ble. If you held 6-5-4-3-2 in your hand, you’d have a 6-high straight as your
high hand and a 6-low as your low one. That’s a very strong hand, one that’s
sometimes good enough to scoop the entire pot — much to your opponents’
consternation.
Knout When to Hold'em and Knout
When to Fold'em
Seven-Stud/8 requires patience. Many people love playing high-low split
games because with two ways to win, they think they will have an opportu-
nity to play more hands. The best Seven-Stud/8 players play few hands and
generally look for those with two-way possibilities. They want hands that
have the potential of becoming low as well as high hands. After all, the objec-
tive of this game is to scoop pots, not split them.
What Kind of Hands Are Likely To Win2
Certain high hands, which are playable in Seven-Card Stud, are quite vulnera-
ble hands in Seven-Stud/8. Starting with a pair of kings or queens in Seven-
Card Stud is usually a good hand. In Seven-Stud/8, however, most players are
looking for low hands that have the potential to become high hands, too.
85
$0
Part I: How to Play the Games
Consequently, an ace with two other low cards is very playable. With an ace,
a player can skewer a pair of kings or queens by catching a companion ace —
even if he was initially trying to make a low hand.
Because most players look for low hands with the potential to become high
hands too, winning high hands tend to be smaller than the high hands typi-
cally made in Seven-Card Stud.
What’s a good low? It all depends on what your opponents’ hands look like.
An 8-7 low can be a terrific hand, as long as all your opponents have face
cards showing and appear to be heading off along the high road. But an 8 low
is a terrible starting hand if you look around the table and see lower cards
staring back at you.
The importance of tide cards
Live cards (cards that help your hand and that are still available) are just as
important in this game as they are in Seven-Card Stud played for high. If you
are trying to complete a low hand, you should be aware of the number of
exposed low cards so that you can estimate your chances of completing your
hand.
Although conventional wisdom suggests starting with low hands that can
become high ones, when most of the low cards are all out, there’s not much
point in continuing with a drawing hand — and all lows are drawing hands
until fifth street, at least.
Starting standards: The first three cards
are critical
Ai
Starting standards (starting hands that you should play) are important in
Seven-Stud/8, just as they are in any form of poker. Some experts say they are
even more important in a split-pot game. Because there are generally a multi-
tude of opponents at the start, it’s a good rule to have the best draw if you
are trying for a low hand. If you don’t have a draw to the best low hand, you’ll
have to rely on getting lucky twice: first, by catching a good card and again,
by hoping that your opponent catches a bad one.
Your first three cards need to work together to make it worthwhile for you to
continue playing. If they work together in both directions, so much the better.
For example, beginning with a hand like Av4v3v is an incredibly good hand.
Not only do you have a draw to a low hand, you also have the possibility of
making a flush for high. If another ace comes your way, you will have a big
Chapter 5:Seven-Card Stud Eight-or-Better,High-Low Split (Seven-Stud/8)
pair and may even improve to two pair or three-of-a-kind. It’s also possible to
wind up with a straight; two pair with a low; or a flushy-low, if you get lucky
enough to make both a flush and a low hand.
One can’t do much better than 3-4-5 as a starting hand. Not only do you have
three low cards, but you have straight potential on both sides, and any ace, 2,
6, or 7 on the next card significantly improves your hand. If you’re fortunate
enough to start with 3v4v5v , you have a hand that can improve to a flush as
well as a straight or a low.
Even if you catch a card like Jv , you’ve improved. Now you have four to a
flush, and although the jack does nothing for your possibilities of making a
low hand, you’re not dead either. That fourth heart keeps you in the hunt,
and if the next card is, for example, the 7*, you have a draw to a low along
with your flush draw — with two chances to complete your hand in one or
two directions.
Suppose you catch the Av on sixth street. What can be better? You’ve made
an ace high heart flush and a 7-5 for low. Now you can typically raise with
impunity. If you have two or three opponents who look like they’re going low,
you will probably take the high side and may scoop it all.
If your opponents are all going high, you will certainly win the low end and
still stand a good chance of scooping, too. With two or more opponents, your
half of the pot should be quite healthy, particularly if you’ve been able to con-
tinue raising your opponents— all of whom are contesting the other end of
the pot.
If you can scoop, you’ll be stacking chips for the next two hands. When you
have a lock on one end of the pot and are freerolling toward the other, you
can reel in some big pots when you’re lucky enough to scoop. (For more
details on freerolling, see the section titled, “Beyond third street” in this
chapter.)
Playable hands
Generally, a desirable starting hand has a two-way possibility that enables
you to scoop a big pot when you get lucky. For example, A #243f is a perfect
starting hand. It begins with three cards to a wheel — the very best possible
low— yet it can easily become a high hand too, by making either a straight
or a flush. If you get extremely lucky, you might even make a straight flush.
Most starting hands are not in its league — not by a long shot. Still, there are
many others that are very playable:

Ace hands
An ace showing on third street is guaranteed to give pause to your oppo-
nents. Aces are like two cards in one, since they’re simultaneously the high-
est and the lowest card in the deck. When you’re showing an ace your
opponent has no idea whether you are going high or low. If your hole cards
are 6-5, you’re working on a very good low. On the other hand, if you have
another ace in the hole, you have the highest hand at that point unless one of
your opponents was dealt three of a kind — and that’s very unlikely.
Continue to catch low cards and your opponent will assume you are drawing
to a low hand. If you catch a high card and continue to contest the pot, your
opponent won’t know what you have. You could be holding a pair of aces.
You might have paired one of your hole cards and now have two pair, or
simply caught a bad card and are foolishly chasing the field for the low side.
Suppose you start with 6*5
hidden and an Av as your exposed card, catch
a 3 on fourth street, then pair your ace on fifth street. Now your opponent
must take a very hard look at his own hand. He’ll see that you’ve paired aces
and has to consider the possibility that you’re holding three of them.
Your opponent also has to consider that you’re holding 4 to a good low along
with a pair of aces as a valid possibility. If you’re holding this kind of hand
against a lone opponent, you stand an excellent chance of scooping the pot.
Aces are not only the most potent card in this game, they are also the most
powerful scare card you can hold. Any card or series of cards that appear to
give you a powerful hand will often “scare” your opponents and cause them
to play cautiously. This can often be a good motivation for you to bluff.
Most of your opponents will play an ace with any two low cards, even if they
are very rough. How playable is a hand like 8-7-A? That depends on your
opponents’ hands. If your opponents are all showing high cards, you have the
only low draw. If you make your hand half the pot will be yours. But if other
low cards are showing you are faced with having to make the best low.
One-Way low hands
A one-way low hand is one that has little or no possibility of becoming a high
hand too. One of the problems with one-way low hands that are unlikely to
make a straight — like 7-3-2, for example — is that they will not make a high
hand unless the holder is fortunate enough to make two pair with a low, or
gets very lucky and makes a flushy-low (a hand that is both a flush and a
low). Since you aren’t likely to make a straight, your chances to scoop are
reduced substantially. It doesn’t necessarily render your hand unplayable,
but it does tend to limit you to playing for one end of the pot only. When you
set off down that road, you should make sure you are the only one headed in
that direction.
Chapter 5: Seven-Card Stud Eight-or-Better, High-Low Split (Seven-Stud/8) 89
Whenever your opponent shows an ace on third street in a heads-up con-
frontation, it spells trouble if all you hold is a one-way low. Not only does
your opponent’s hand look to be a better low than yours, it’s also a better
high. That ace has surrounded you, and regardless of the direction you are
heading, it’s probably uphill. Your opponent often either scoops or splits the
pot. As for your one-way low, you split the pot or you get scooped. You’re
better off folding one-way hands most of the time that you’re heads-up
against an opponent showing an ace.
An ace is tike Mo cards in one
The ace is both a low and a high card, so holding one is like having an extra
card. It’s almost like playing eight cards against your opponent’s seven. But
as strong as an ace is, not every hand containing an ace is playable. A hand
like 9-8-A probably won’t win regardless of whether you’re trying to build a
high hand or a low one. You’ll find more than enough hands to play in Seven-
Stud/8, so do yourself a favor: Even when your ace is smiling out at the world,
toss it away if your hole cards are dogs.
Tu/o-u/ag hands
Two-way hands are the most desirable of all. With a little bit of luck, low
hands can become high hands, but high hands don’t become low hands very
often.
If you begin with a hand like 6-5-3 you’re on your way to a good low, but with
a bit of luck you might also make a straight and scoop the pot. Three low-
suited cards are even better because they can make a flush or a straight to go
along with a low hand.
On the other hand, try starting with three high cards and see how difficult it
is to go low. After all, if you were dealt Q-J-10, you have a straight working,
but how are you ever going to make a low hand and scoop? You can’t. It’s that
simple. That doesn’t mean you can’t ever play high cards; but it does mean
you have to consider the situation very carefully.
i
Disguised hands
While high hands can sometimes masquerade as low ones, it’s tough for a
high hand to cloak itself in disguise. After all, if you call with a jack showing,
you’ll have a tough time convincing anyone that you are working on a low
hand. You might have a pair, a straight draw, or a flush draw. Your opponents
won’t know that, but they will know where you’re headed, and that’s more
important.
High hands
If all of your opponents are building low hands, and you have a good high
hand working, you should usually go ahead and play it. Unless one of your
opponents makes a low straight or a flush, chances are your high hand can
hold up. If you both make two pair, yours will likely take the high side.
QQ
Part I: How to Play the Games
Whenever you are the only player going high and you are up against two or
more opponents trying to make a low, you’re in good shape unless someone
begins catching aces.
High against (out: one-on-one
You can also play a high hand profitably when you are up against one oppo-
nent who looks like he is working on a low hand. If you have even so much as
a high pair on third street, your odds of winning are good. Here’s why: You
already have a hand. Your opponent, particularly if she starts off with a one
way low — where making a straight is just about impossible — is still draw-
ing, and has no guarantee of succeeding.
Your opponent might start off with four low cards and catch three high cards
in succession and never take the low side. You will usually take the whole pot
or split it; while your opponent — unless she is fortunate enough to make a
two-way hand or back into a better high hand than yours — will either split
the pot or lose it. This is almost a “heads I win, tails you lose” encounter, and
you can’t hope for much more than that.
If you are going to draw for a low hand, you’d ideally like to be up against a
gaggle of high hands — a guarantee that you’ll take half the pot if you make a
low. You seldom want to compete with a bunch of low hands for half the pot
against a lone high hand.
Powerhouse hands
Another time it pays to go high, regardless of how many opponents you are
up against, is when you start with a powerhouse hand. If you were dealt three
jacks, for example, you shouldn’t mind any number of opponents who also
appear to be going high. You already have three-of-a-kind, along with a good
chance of improving to a full house or better. You are heavily favored, and
you should exploit the opportunity for all it’s worth by betting and raising at
every opportunity.
When playing Seven-Stud/8, conventional wisdom suggests that you begin
with a low hand and try to scoop the pot by making a high hand, too. That’s a
lot easier than starting with high cards and hoping to make a low one. The
objective of this game is to scoop pots— not split them — so it’s important
to play hands that have two-way potential. Most of the time, that means start-
ing with low cards.
Chapter 5: Seven-Card Stud Eight-or-Better, High-Low Split (Seven-Stud/8) ^
/
Beyond third street
Choosing to continue beyond third street means that your next key decision
point occurs on the very next betting round. If you hope to make a low hand
but catch a high card on fourth street, it severely diminishes your chances of
completing your hand. If you catch a fourth low card, however, you stand a
good chance of succeeding.
If you catch a good card on fourth street and an opponent (who also has
what looks like a low draw) catches a high card, then you can raise if some-
one bets. That tactic makes it very difficult for any opponent to call once he
sees two low cards on your board. If you can chase other low draws out of
the pot, it no longer matters how good your low is, as long as it is the only '
low hand in the battle.
If you make the only low hand, you can raise whenever someone bets — and
you can do so with the complete assurance that half of all the money going
into that pot will soon be yours. This nifty but rare situation is called
freerolling— where you hold the best possible low hand and there is no cost
or risk to drawing for the high hand.
Calling on fifth street in Seven-Stud/8 does not necessarily represent the
same commitment to the hand that it does in Seven-Card Stud. If you have a
low draw and catch a bad card on sixth street while an opponent catches a
very good one, it can be correct to release your hand in the face of a bet.
But if you have a high hand and are still active on fifth street, the pot is gener-
ally big enough to continue to the end.
When everyone has tout cards shoiViny
If you find yourself up against a few opponents on third street with 2s, 3s, 4s,
5s, or 6s showing, you can usually be certain they are also going low. When
one of your opponents has an ace as his door card (the first card dealt face
up), he could be going high or low, or have a two-way hand like A-2/A. (The
two cards to the left of the slash were dealt face down. The card to the right
was dealt face up.) With a low door card other than an ace, you can safely
assume that most of your opponents also will have two other low cards.
The following scenario can be a real dilemma: If you start with three low
cards and three opponents also call with low board cards, you can assume
that there are probably 12 cards between and ace and an 8 already out. If
that’s the case, it means that 12 out of the 32 low cards, or 38 percent of all
the low cards in the deck, have already been dealt.
^2
Part I: How to Play the Games
To illustrate some important concepts, imagine the following:
v* No aces are showing.
u0 You hold three good low cards.
u0 Three of your opponents also appear to be going low.
v* A player showing a king also calls.
It’s obvious why the king is in the pot — he’s going high. Four of you are trying
for the low side, and one or two may have two-way hands. Approximately 20
low cards remain in the deck— more, if some of your opponents are poor
players who will play weak hands like 3-J/2, and fewer, if others folded hands
like 3-7/10. You’ll never know for sure, but you are in the ballpark.
Suppose you started with 3-4/5. Catching another 3, 4, or 5 is not what you
are hoping for. An 8 gives you four cards to a low — but against three other
opponents heading in the same direction yours is probably the worst four-
card low of the lot.
Either a 2 or a 6 is a perfect catch. With either of those cards you have a good
low draw along with an open-ended straight draw for high. An ace is a terrific
low card — in addition, it provides an inside draw to a wheel. Catching a 7
keeps you in the hunt by providing a good-but-not-great four-card low, along
with an inside straight draw for high.
Your opponent with the high hand is in a good situation at this point. Not only
does the distribution of high versus low cards help her, she is not really hurt if
she holds a big pair and catches a low card. In fact, that’s one low card her
opponents can’t catch. Moreover, if she catches high cards she may make two
pair or trips, assuming she started with a big pair and a big, live side card.
Frustrations can mount in Seven-Stud/8, particularly when you start with
three good low cards and catch a face card or a bad low card and have to
abandon your hand. That’s the nature of the game. The frustration factor in
Seven-Stud/8causes many players to play almost any starting hand, and
that’s when they lose money. Even experienced players occasionally lose
patience after waiting for good starting hands that they have to release once
they’ve caught a bad card or two on subsequent betting rounds.
Do big hands equal big profits )
Not atu/ays
Big hands are not always big money makers, and that’s often frustrating. You
might be dealt three kings and catch the fourth king on the next card against
one opponent who is obviously drawing for low. You can bet and raise to the
4

hilt, but if he makes a low hand, you’ll only split the antes and the bring-in
when all the shouting is done. That’s not much of a return on four-of-a-kind,
endlessly raised, is it?
Jamming the pot
\\V
*\NG/
£
V"
When you make a two-way hand that has a lock on at least one side, you can —
and should — jam (raise as much as possible) the pot at every opportunity.
You get to scoop the pot if you’re lucky, and whenever there are multiple oppo-
nents, each dollar you bet generates a profit even when you split it.
Tread lightly on the other side of this two-edged sword, however, and avoid'
situations where you are the one being sliced and diced. You can’t avoid this
entirely. You might find yourself against two or three high hands, while you
have the only low draw. There’s no guarantee that you’ll complete your hand,
and if you do not catch the cards you need, you may wind up calling all the
way to the river only to fold your hand.
Nevertheless, you can avoid drawing for one side of the pot whenever your
hand figures to be second best if your opponent also completes his draw.
There are some players who will always draw to an 8-low against opponents
who are drawing to a low that’s obviously better. When both players make
their hand, the second-best hand suffers for his indiscretion.
Seven-Stud/8 is filled with twists and turns, and that’s what makes it such an
exciting game: It’s the made hand versus the big draw. It’s going to the river
with a two-way draw. It’s starting out low and finishing high. It’s freerolling to
a scoop, and it’s the frustration of making a very big hand that only chops the
antes when your opponent takes the other half of the pot.
93
When you hold the only lou/ hand
When you make the only low hand, you’re guaranteed half the pot. You also
have more good drawing cards available to you. If you’re the only one going
low, catching an 8 is as good as any other low card. Make your hand early and
you can enjoy jamming the high hands with impunity. When you’re compet-
ing with others for low, however, there’s no guarantee that yours will be the
best one. It doesn’t pay to jam the high hands if you might not capture your
share of the pot. There’s nothing more vexing — or costly — than making a
low and losing to a better one, particularly if the signals were there all along.

The deck is probably full of high cards at that
point.
V 1-
Players who start with any three low cards, particularly those with neither
straight nor flush potential, are doomed to usually draw for only half the pot
with no guarantee they’ll complete their low. Face it, there is always a high
hand; there doesn’t necessarily have to be a low one. This is a money-losing
proposition in the long run.
Hour SeVeti-Stud/8 Differs From
Seven-Card Stud
How well you play your first three cards in Seven-Card Stud poker is one of
the keys to success. Successful play demands an awareness of whether the
cards that can improve your hand are still alive. Seven-Card Stud players also
need to anticipate what players acting after them might do, based on their
door cards.
$i
These considerations also hold true for Seven-Stud/8. But that’s where the
road forks. In Seven-Card Stud once you decide to play the hand you’ve been
dealt, the next major decision point is fifth street — buy a card there and
you’ve bought a through-ticket to the river. Seven-Card Stud pundits do not
usually offer much salient advice about play on fourth street. It’s almost as
though you’re expected to play it on autopilot.
How you play that fourth card is critical, however, when you play Seven-
Stud/8. Misunderstanding its importance can be a major blunder.
If you play Seven-Stud/8 correctly, most of the time you’ll be starting with
three low cards— and it is these three low cards that make fourth street so
very critical. If you start with three low cards, you’ll still need to catch two
cards lower than a 9 — that do not pair your hand — out of the next four
cards dealt to you, in order to make a low hand. In other words, half of your
next four cards must be small for you to succeed.
Chapter 5: Seven-Card Stud Eight-or-Betterr High-Low Split (Seven-Stud/8)
VNG/
Suppose you catch a high card on fourth street, or a card that pairs one of
the three cards already in your hand. If you catch a face card on fourth street
you’ll usually find four dragons raising their fire-breathing heads.
First, you have substantially reduced your chances of making a low hand.
Now two of the next three cards must be low for you to even have a chance at
half the pot.
Second, you can’t possibly make your hand until sixth street. Even when you
do make it, you’ll have one less round of betting to jam the pot if you are
lucky enough to be competing against two or more opponents who are slug-
ging it out for the high side.
Third, if you catch a high card and someone else going low catches a smaller
one, she is now far ahead in the race. She needs only one more low card out
of the final three that she will be dealt in order to complete her hand.
Meanwhile, you need to catch two low cards out of the next three to even
compete in the race — and there’s no guarantee yours will be the best low
hand. If your opponent makes a low hand before you do, you can expect her
to raise anytime there is a bet. A skillful opponent will make it expensive for
you to stick around and draw out on her.
Fourth, you might catch a low card that pairs one of your hole cards. Yes, it’s
true: You do have a start at a high hand, but it’s a marginal one. There is one
saving grace, however. An opponent who is also going low will not know you
paired. If she catches a face card, she’ll probably fold if you bet or raise
before it’s her turn to act. Even if you can eliminate her, however, you’ll still
need to make a low hand to escape with half the pot.
Suppose you started with a terrific low hand, like 5-4/3and catch an 8 on
fourth street. This is not nearly as bad as catching a face card, since you have
a four-card low, but how will you feel about your hand if you look over and
see that one of your opponents is showing a 6-5 and another a 4-3? The only
way you have the best low draw on fourth street is if both your opponents
have at least one bad card in the pocket.
Hidden Hands
Hidden hands (like a pair of aces in the hole with a low door card or finding
that you’ve been dealt three 4s) are terrific in Seven-Stud/8 because they are
rather rare. When you think someone is trying to make a low hand, they usu-
ally are. If you have a high hand that looks like a low one, however, you stand
a very good chance of winning a big pot. You can keep betting and raising,
because the opponent who mistakenly thinks he has the only high hand will
be betting and raising too. He’ll think you and the other low hand are slug-
ging it out for half of the pot, while he’s guaranteed his share. He won’t sus-
pect that he’s the one who’s going to be sliced and diced at the showdown.
95
^
Part I: How to Play the Games
Sometimes you can scoop the pot by making a two-way hand — any low
straight stands a terrific chance of scooping, as does the relatively rare and
wonderfully nicknamed flushy-low (a flush and low hand). Even two pair with
a low will frequently scoop a fairly big pot. Most of the time, however, you’ll
be playing a one-way hand, and when you are, the only way to scoop is to
eliminate opponents who are heading in the other direction.
Driving and Braking
If you’re dealt a big pair early, you have a hand that already has some intrin-
sic value. If you start with three low cards, however, all you have is a draw—
as yet unrealized — and as good as those three low cards look, there’s always
a chance that a low hand will never be completed. If three of your next four
cards are 9s or higher you will have missed your low and unless you miracu-
lously back into a high hand, you’ll lose the pot too.
Nevertheless, if you make the only low hand by fifth or sixth street, along
with a chance to improve to a high hand too, you have half the pot won
against opponents who hold high-only hands, and you can bet or raise with
complete safety. If you make a straight, or any other good high hand to com-
plement your low, you might scoop the pot. What’s more, you’re in a good
freeroll position.
Some interesting strategic concepts include knowing when to drive a hand by
betting or raising, and understanding when to put on the brakes by trying to
complete your hand inexpensively. If you have a high hand, you need to bet
and raise early and often to make it as expensive as possible for anyone
drawing to a low hand to play against you. After all, you want to avoid split-
ting the pot. You’d also like to avoid the indignity of an opponent’s low draw
backing into a high hand and scooping the entire pot right out from under
your nose.
The only way to ensure that you’ll win the entire pot when you have a high
hand is for the low draw to release his hand. Your opponent is not going to
do that of his own accord; you must induce him to do so. The best way to
accomplish this is to bet at him, or raise when he bets. Remember, before
fifth street, it’s impossible for your opponent to have a completed low hand.
He may have a terrific draw, but it’s still a draw, not a made hand — and even
a single high pair is temporarily the better hand at that juncture.
From a practical standpoint, you’ll find it nearly impossible to force an oppo-
nent to release a low draw unless he catches a face card on fourth or fifth
street. If he does, and you come out betting, he’ll realize that the odds against
his completing a low hand have just escalated, and drawing for half a pot
might start looking like the losing proposition it often is.

You won’t always be so lucky. If your opponent keeps catching low cards
(also known as babies), he’s probably going to complete his low hand. If you
bet and he raises on fifth or sixth street with a low board showing, you can be
certain he’s made a low hand and is now freerolling for a high hand, or worse
yet, already has a better high hand than yours, as well as a low one.
M\HG!
If you suspect your opponent has made a low hand, it’s time to stop driving
and apply the brakes. (See the sidebar “Driving and braking in Seven-Stud/8.)
Once your opponent has made a low hand, the strategic elements have now
completely reversed themselves — as long as your high hand has no low pos-
sibilities. At best, you are now the player taking aim at half the pot. At worst,
you will get scooped. Since that’s the case, what earthly reason could you
have for betting into this pot?
The best you can do is break even — which will happen a lot of the time—
although you’ll lose the entire pot occasionally. If your opponent has made a
low hand and you are foolish enough to bet your high hand, he’s going to
raise at every opportunity. He has nothing to lose. Half the pot is already his,
and he has an opportunity to win it all.
Part I: How to Play the Games
When All the Cards Hat/e Been Dealt
If you’ve seen the hand through to the river, you usually should call any bet if
you think you can escape with half the pot. If your opponent appears to have
a low hand, sometimes even a paltry pair can capture the high side of the pot.
If it’s heads-up and you have a high hand while your opponent appears to
have made a low hand, there’s no point in betting. At best, you’ll just split the
pot. At worst, he’ll have a high hand to complement his low and might scoop
the entire pot.

Playing Omaha High-Only
#maha Hold’em, 8-or-Better High-Low Split Poker is quite a mouthful — so
you can just call it Omaha/8 for short. “The game of the future,” as many
poker pundits predict, is a variation of Texas Hold’em in which each player
receives four cards dealt face down. Like its cousin, Texas Hold’em (see
Chapter 4), five community cards — which every player can use— are dealt
face up in the center of the table. The best high hand and the best low hand
split the pot.
As in most split-pot games, lots of chips may be on the table because some
players are trying to make the best low hand, some the best high one, while
others are trying to scoop the entire pot.
Omaha/8 also creates action because each player is dealt four cards rather
than the two that Texas Hold’em players receive. Naturally, with four cards to
choose from, many players don’t have any trouble finding a hand they think
is worth playing.
Although you may get confused at times trying to ferret out the best five-card
poker hand from among the five community cards on the center of the table
and the four private cards in each player’s hand, don’t worry —- if you can play
Texas Hold’em, you can play Omaha/8. We also cover Omaha High (a high-only
variation of Omaha/8 that is played less frequently) later in this chapter.
100
Part l; How to Play the Games
Playing Omaha/8 for the First Time
Omaha/8 looks almost like Texas Hold’em, which you’ve undoubtedly mas-
tered after reading Chapter 4, but you can expect four major differences:
i* Omaha/8 is a high-low split game, which means more players in each
pot, more chips in the center of the table, and more action.
Each player must make his best five-card poker hand by using exactly
two cards from his hand and three communal cards. In Texas Hold’em,
you can form the best hand using two, one, or even none of your private
cards. If you are playing Texas Hold’em and you hold the ace of spades
when the board contained four additional spades, you have a flush. But
in Omaha, you have nothing at all. That’s because you must play two
cards— no more, no less — to make a valid Omaha hand.
Because you have four cards to work with, you can form six different
starting combinations. In other words, by receiving four private cards,
you have six times as many potential starting hands as you do as you do
in Texas Hold’em. As a result, the winning hands tend to be quite a bit
bigger than they do in Texas Hold’em.
v* Straights and flushes are common; and two pair, which is often a winning
hand in Texas Hold’em, seldom wins in this game. Regardless of how
powerful a high hand you make, whenever three unpaired communal
cards with a rank of 8 or lower are on the board, someone probably
made a low hand and that big pot you were hoping to win has effectively
been chopped in half.
Blind bets
Before any cards are dealt, the first two players to the left of the dealer posi-
tion are required to post blind bets, which are used instead of antes to stimu-
late action. (For a more thorough discussion of blind bets, see Chapters 2
and 4.)
In a $6—$12 Omaha/8 game, blinds are usually $3 and $6. Each blind is consid-
ered live. Because blinds represent a forced, first bet, the players forced to
post those bets can raise (but only on the first round) after the betting has
gone around the table and it is their turn to act again.
Unlike Stud poker, where position is determined by the cards showing on the
board, the player with the dealer button acts last in every round of betting —
with the exception of the first one.
Chapter 6: Omaha /Q /
The deal and betting structure
Four cards are dealt face down to each player, and a round of betting takes
place. On the first round, players may either call or raise the blind bet, or fold
their hands. Most casinos allow a bet and three or four raises per betting
round, with one exception. When only two players contest the pot, the
number of possible raises is unlimited.
When the first round of betting is complete, three communal cards, called the
flop, are simultaneously turned face up in the center of the table. Another
round of betting follows, On this and each succeeding round, players may
check if no one has bet when it is that player’s turn to act. If there is no bet, a
j
player may check or bet. If there is a bet, players must either fold, call, raise,
or reraise.
A fourth communal card — called the turn — is then exposed. Another
round of betting takes place. Then the fifth and final community card —
known as the river— is placed in the center of the table, followed by the
final betting round.
II!
The best five-card high poker hand and the best five-card low poker hand
split the pot — with these provisos:
1 u* A player must use exactly two cards— no more, no less (from among his
I
four private cards) to construct a poker hand.
I
To have a low hand, a player must combine any two unpaired cards with
|
a rank of 8 or lower with three unpaired communal cards with a rank of 8
I
or lower.
A player can make a high and a low hand by using different cards from his
hand to construct the two hands. For example, if your private cards are
A+2^3vKv and the five communal cards are Qv9*7v6v4*, you have a
flush. The flush is made by mating your Kv3v with the communal Qv7v6v .
You’d have a low hand too, which would be created by combining your A+2^
with the board’s 7v6v4*.
You’d have a terrific two-way hand. Although it’s possible for an opponent to
have made a bigger flush if she held the Av and any other heart in her hand,
no one could have a better low hand than you do. You could be tied for low
by anyone who also has an ace and a 2. In that case, you’d simply split the
low side of the pot. But take our word for it, this is a terrific holding, and one
that doesn’t come around all that often.

Beginning players often have difficulty in determining the best Omaha hand.
Before you plunk your money down and get in a game, we recommend deal-
ing out some hands and trying to identify the best high and best low hands.

Knowing When to Hold ’em
andWhen to Fold’em
Although Omaha looks confusing, you can take solace in the fact that even
professional casino dealers sometimes have trouble determining the best
hand. Having to look for high as well as low hands with so many card combi-
nations probably leads to brain-lock on occasion. Don’t worry. When you get
used to the game, you will be able to quickly spot potential draws and win-
ning combinations.
With four cards in their hands, many players can always find something
worth playing. These players are, of course, playing far too many weak hands
that really don’t warrant an investment and should be discarded rather than
played. Even beginning Omaha/8 players can be considered a favorite in
lower-limit games simply by playing better starting cards than their oppo-
nents play.

Even experienced players often fail to realize that split-pot games are illusory
in the sense that it appears as though one can play many more hands than
they can in a game where only the high hand wins. But winning players are
more selective than their opponents, and they enter pots only with hands
that are superior to those that their opponents play most of the time.

Part I: How to Play the Games
Omaha/8seems even more confusing when you have a two-way hand and must
determine whether you have the best low hand as well as the best high one.
Although determining the best high and low hands (see Figure 6-1) requires
concentration, Omaha/8’s underlying precept is simple: The ideal hands are
those that can capture the entire pot. That usually means beginning with low
hands that also offer an opportunity to grow into a straight or flush. You
can also start with big, high cards and hope for a flop containing nothing but
high cards. When this happens, the pot will tend to be a bit smaller. But it
won’t be split either. Whenever the flop contains three big cards, all the one-
way low draws have to fold. Their investment is dead money in the pot, and
the pot will go to the winning high hand.
Position, position, and position
Position is fixed for the entire hand in Omaha/8, just as in Texas Hold’em.
This means that if you are in late position and the pot has not been raised,
you can see the flop with hands that are a bit weaker than you normally
would consider playing, because you have less chance of being raised.
Position can give you an opportunity to get lucky with certain hands that
can’t profitably be played in a raised pot.
In a typical nine-handed game, early position includes both blinds and the
two players to their left. The fifth, sixth, and seventh players to act are in
middle position, and the eighth and ninth players are in late position.
The flop should fit your hand
Poker writer Shane Smith coined the phrase, “fit or fold.” It’s particularly true
in Omaha/8. The flop must fit your hand, by providing you with a good,
strong hand or a draw to the best possible hand. If the flop doesn’t meet
those criteria, you likely should release your hand.
Omaha/8 in Depth
Nearly endless combinations are possible with four-card starting hands, but
you need not be concerned with too many of them — most are easily recog-
nizable as hands you will release with neither remorse nor regret.
The best Omaha/8 starting combinations are coordinated, and they work
together in some way. Many of your opponents will play hands in which only
three of the four cards are coordinated, and others will play any four cards
that look good.
Chapter 6: Omaha
Starting hands
The following sections offer examples of Omaha/8 starting hands; of course,
these are not the only possibilities. In the first example, a hand like A-2-3-5 is
just about as good as A-2-3-4.
The Very best
A+2+3+4*: A suited ace with three low cards can make the nut low, as
well as a straight, and the nut flush. By having sequenced low cards, you
have protection against being counterfeited if one, or even two, of your
low cards hit the board. You are said to be counterfeited if one of your
low cards is duplicated on the board, thus weakening your hand consid-
erably. For example, you hold A-2-7-9, and the board is 3-4-8. At this
point, you have the best possible low hand (8-4-3-2-A). Suppose the turn
card is a deuce. Now your low hand is 7-4-3-2-A, but it is no longer the
nut low, and if an opponent holds A-5 in his hand, he will have an
unbeatable low hand, as well as a 5-high straight (called a wheel or bicy-
cle for a high hand, too).
u* A*K+3+4*: A-K double-suited offers two flush combinations, two
straight combinations, a draw to a very good low hand, and protection
against making a low and having it counterfeited.
u* A*A +2+3*: A pair of aces, two nut flush draws, a low hand with counter-
feit protection, and a draw to the nut low are the features of this hand.
v0 A*AvK+Kv: No low possibilities here, but a double-suited A-K is a very
powerful hand, because you can make a straight, two flushes, and sets of
aces or kings that can become a full house if the board pairs.
^ A+2*349V:Only three of the cards are coordinated, but with a large
number of players in the pot, you have a draw to the nut low with coun-
terfeit protection.
Vert} good hands
k* A*2*545V: Flush draw, nut low draw, straight draw are some of the
possibilities. You might also flop a set to your pair of 5s. A-2 suited with
any pair can be counterfeited for low and is not as strong as the very
best hands, but it is a good hand nevertheless.
id0 A*Q*J«10v: You’d like tosee either all picture cards on the flop in
hopes of making the best possible straight, or three clubs. If you flop a
flush and two small cards are present, you must bet or raise at every
opportunity to make it as costly as possible for low hands to draw
against you. If a low hand is made, you’ve lost half your equity in this pot.
105

Part I: How to Play the Games
SflNG/
£
2*344*5*: You’re hoping an ace falls along with two other low cards.
If it does, you’ve made the nut low and you probably have a straight
draw, too.
^ A*345A7V: Although this is good low draw along with nut flush possi-
bilities, you won’t make the best possible low hand unless the commu-
nity cards include a 2. But you can easily make the second best low
hand, which often spells trouble. Suppose that David holds A-3-x-x,
Karen has 3-4-x-x, and Abby has A-2-x-x. Suppose that, at the end of the
hand, the board is K-K-8-7-5. All three players made low hands, but Abby
made the best possible low hand. David’s hand is the second-best possi-
ble low hand, and if he were to bet and Abby were to raise, David would
lose the low half of the pot.
MiG/
m
Other playable hands that aren't ready for prime time
1 t* K*2*3*4v:This hand offers a draw to a flush, though it’s not the nut
flush, and a draw to a low hand that won’t be the best low unless an ace
hits the board. Nevertheless, it is playable in late position, although this
kind of hand often must be released if the flop doesn’t fit it precisely
§ u* K+K+ IO^ IOA: Here’s a hand that can make a straight, albeit with great
difficulty and can make a flush, although it is not the best flush. The
hand can improve to a set or a full house, too. It’s playable, but it’s the
kind of hand that looks a lot stronger than it really is.
I v* 8A9V10 AJA: This is a straight draw with no flush possibilities. If you
make a 5-6-7-8-9 straight, any low hand will take half of this pot. If you
make a big straight, you run the risk of losing the entire pot to a higher
If
one. Mid-range cards are dicey holdings in Omaha/8, and this is another
^
of those hands that looks a lot better than it is.
I v* KAQ + 2+3*:This is a good-looking hand that can also lead to trouble.
On the plus side, it’s double-suited, providing two flush draws. And two
|
straight draws are also possible, as well as a low hand. But the down
side is that neither flush draw contains an ace, and you can’t make the
best possible low unless an ace appears among the communal cards.
|
This hand and many others like it are what poker players call trouble
hands.They’re seductive, and even when you catch what appears to be
a good hand, it might be more trouble than it’s worth. Hands like this are
always treacherous and often can be disastrous.
1^ 5*64748*: Mid-range cards spell trouble — even double-suited, as in
I
this example. With mid-range cards, you stand very little chance of
scooping a pot. On the other hand, you can be scooped, particularly
when you make a straight and your opponent makes a higher card
I
straight.
Chapter 6: Omaha 107
Getting good at hand selection
Every form of poker requires a blend of skills. But in Omaha/8, hand selection
far outweighs other skills. Because any hand that is possible is also probable
in Omaha/8, you need not be an expert at reading your opponents. Just read-
ing the community cards to ascertain the best possible hand is usually
enough. Bluffing, too, is not nearly as important in Omaha/8 as in other forms
of poker.
For example, if you are playing Texas Hold’em and all the cards are out, you
may be successful if you try to bluff against one or two opponents. But not in
Omaha/8. With four starting cards in their hands, each player has six starting
combinations. Trying to bluff two players is like trying to run a bluff against a
dozen starting hand combinations. The tactic’s not going to work most of the
time.
A
In fact, if you never bluffed at all in Omaha/8, you’d probably be better off.
Because one does not need to bluff, or even possess the ability to read his
opponents, the critical skill required to win at this game is hand selection.
Some players start with almost any four cards, and if you can exert the disci-
pline to wait for good starting cards— hands that are coordinated, with
cards that support each other in some discernable way — you can have an
edge over most of your opponents.
Acting last is a big advantage
You can afford tosee the flop with weaker hands when you’re in a late posi-
tion. The later you act, the more information you can expect at your disposal,
and poker is a game of information — incomplete information, to be sure, but
a game of information nevertheless.
Looking for a flop
Before you decide to call with the four cards you’ve been dealt, ask yourself
what kind of flop would be ideal for your hand. And when you see the flop,
determine which hand would be perfect for it. This kind of analysis will help
you ascertain how well the flop fits your hand.
Here are eight convenient ways to characterize Omaha/8 flops:
10$
Part I: Howto Play the Games
v0 Paired: When a pair flops, the best possible high hand is four-of-a-kind
(which players refer to as quads), unless a straight flush possibly exists
Although flopping quads is a rarity, a full house is a distinct possibility
u* Flush or flush draw: Three or two cards of the same suit.
v* Straight or straight draw: Three or two cards in sequence, or gapped
closely enough so that a straight is possible.
v0 High: Three or two cards above an 8. If three cards higher in rank than
an 8 flop, no low hand is possible.
Low or low draw: Three or two cards with the rank of 8 or lower.
$
A
These groupings are not mutually exclusive. Some of these attributes can
appear in combination. For example, if the flop were A*2*24 it would be
both paired as well as low, and contain a flush draw as well as a straight draw.
It’s important to recognize when a flop has multiple possibilities and to
understand how your hand stacks up in the pecking order of possibilities.
Suppose you called on the first round of betting with A4243*KA, and the
flop is Q4544*. You don’t have a completed hand at this point. But do have a
draw to the best flush and the best low hand. In poker parlance, you have a
draw to the nut flush and the nut low. Any diamond gives you the best possi-
ble flush. Of course, if that card happens to be the 44 someone else could
make a full house if that player holds a pair of queens or a pair of 5s in his
hand, or he would make four-of-a-kind if he is holding a pair of 4s.
If any card with the rank of 8 or lower falls, and it does not pair one of the low
cards on the board, you have the best possible low hand. You also have a
straight draw, and if a third diamond shows its face and doesn’t pair the
board, you also hold the nut flush.
If a 2 falls, then the 2 in your hand is said to be counterfeited, because that 2
on the board belongs to everyone. Nevertheless, you still have the best possi-
ble low hand. That third low card in your hand provides insurance against
being counterfeited.
The unpleasant experience
of being quartered
When you win only one-fourth of a pot because you’ve split the low half of
that pot with another opponent, both of you are said to have been quartered.
Chapter 6: Omaha
If only three players contest a hand, and two of them tie for low, each of the
low hands loses money even though each wins one-fourth of the pot. Here’s
how to figure it:Suppose each of you put $40 dollars in the pot. If you are
quartered for low, the high hand takes half of the $120 in the pot for his share.
The remaining $60 is then divided in half. Each of the low hands receives $30.
Because each of you contributed $40, the return on your investment is only 75
cents on the dollar — if you keep winning pots like that, you’ll go broke.
With four players in the pot, you can be quartered and break even. With five
or more players, you come out a bit ahead if you’re quartered. Nevertheless,
being quartered is anything but a journey down the primrose path.
Worse than being quartered is playing hands that do not have much of a
chance to make the best hand in one or both directions. If you play mid-range
cards, like 9-8-7-6, you may make a straight but wind up splitting the pot with
a low hand. If you make the bottom end of a straight with Q-J-10, you don’t
have to worry about a low hand taking half the pot, but you do have to worry
about losing the entire pot to a bigger straight.
*****
* ill
Playing low draws that do not contain an ace and a 2 is an invitation to make
the second-best low hand, which is how many Omaha/8 players lose money.
They play hands that look good, but are not good enough to become the best
hand in their direction.
Beyond the ftop
As a general rule, you shouldn’t continue beyond the flop without the best
possible hand or a draw to the best possible high hand, low hand or both.
With six conceivable two-card combinations in each player’s hand, a lot of
hands are possible, so make certain that you’ll have the best hand if you
catch the card you need.
Here’s an example: Suppose the flop is K-8-7 of mixed suits, and you hold 2-3
among your four cards. If 4, 5, or a 6 hits the board, you’ll make a low hand
but so will your opponent who was drawing to an A-2. Once you see the flop,
here are some things to think about before deciding whether to keep playing:
I ^ Draw quality: If you make your hand, will it be the nuts? Suppose you
|
have QAJA among your starting cards and the flop contains two other
spades. Although you have a flush draw, two higher flushes are possible.
I
This is a dangerous hand. Drawing to the second or third best straight,
i
drawing to the second or third best low hand, or thinking you have
|
this pot won because you flopped the third best or second best set are
I
common variations on this theme. Omaha/8 is a game of drawing to
1
the nuts.

Part I: How to Play the Games
Pot percentage: How much of the pot are you hoping to win? Do you
have a hand that might scoop the pot if you make it? Are you drawing
for the top half of the pot or drawing for low only? More than one player
can have a draw to the best low hand, and unless you have at least four
opponents, you can expect to lose money whenever you are quartered.
Opponents: Some hands play better against large fields; others play well
short-handed. With a flush draw or a straight draw, you need five or six
opponents to make the draw worthwhile if you figure to split the pot.
v0 Pot size: Determine how much money will you win if you scoop the pot,
if you take half of it, or if you are quartered.
v0 Raised or not: When the pot is raised before the flop in Omaha/8, the
raiser usually has a superb low hand, such as A-2-3-4, or A-2-3-K, with the
ace suited to another of his cards. If the flop contains all big cards, you
probably have nothing more to fear from the raiser.
What to Do When l/ou'(/e Been Raised
If the pot has been raised before you act, tighten up on the hands you play.
When you are raised before the flop, the raiser invariably has an outstanding
low hand. If you have any low draw other than A-2 along with protection
against being counterfeited, throw your hand away.
Since bluffing is infrequent in Omaha/8, if you are raised after the flop, the
raiser usually has one of the following:
|v0 The best possible high hand
|v0 The nut low with a draw to a high hand
t ^ A big hand with a draw to a good low
As in all forms of poker, you need a stronger hand to call a raise than to initi-
ate one. Before you call a raise in Omaha/8, give your opponent credit for a
strong hand — and quite possibly a strong hand in one direction and a draw
to an equally strong hand in another. Call only if you believe your hand is
stronger.
Flopping a drauJ
Here’s how to decide whether to continue with your draw if you flop a 4-flush
or a 4-straight.
Chapter 6: Omaha
When you're facing three or more opponents, a draw is worthwhile if you
think you’ll win the entire pot by making your hand. If you have a draw to a
high straight or flush and you are certain one of your opponents already has
a low hand, half the pot will go to your opponent, so you’ll need five or six
opponents to make the draw profitable.
But if you have a draw and only two low cards are on the board, don’t be
afraid to bet, or even raise to make it expensive for opponents to draw for
their half of the pot. If that low hand never materializes, their investment is
dead money and you’ll claim it if you make your hand.
Table 6-2 shows how likely you are to make a low hand.

HoW do my opponents play?
If your opponents are loose players, you can draw to the second best high
hand; but if your opponents are tight players, you probably don’t want to
continue unless you have a draw to the best hand or have already made it.
What in the World could my

If the pot has been raised, you have to think about what kinds of hands your
opponent would raise with, as well as the hands other players in the pot need
to justify calling a raise.

If you think you might be raised if you call, you need a much stronger hand

Hout much urilt it cost to see the hand
through to its conclusion?
This is poker’s essential risk/reward issue. The amount of money you’re likely
to win if you make your hand should be higher than the odds against making
your hand. In other words, if you think you’ll win $30 on a $5 investment, it
pays to stick around as long as the odds against making your hand are less
than 6-to-l.
If you can win $30 for an investment of $5, the relationship between the cost
of your investment and the size of the pot is 30-to-5, which reduces to 6-to-l.
i
If the odds against making your hand are only 3-to-l, then this represents a
good bet. But if you were a 9-to-l underdog, you’re better off folding your hand.
Playing the Rider
Because of all the straight, flush, and full house possibilities generated when
each player’s four-card private hands combine with five board cards, an
Omaha/8 game is frequently decided on the last (or river) card. Omaha/8 is
very different than Texas Hold’em in this regard. Texas Hold’em is a flop
game, and the best hand on the flop is frequently the best hand on the river.
But that’s not the case with Omaha. If there are five active players going into
the river, you can be sure that at least three of them have one or more draw-
ing combinations in their hands. Even the two players currently holding the
best high and low hands also might have draws to better hands. With so many
possibilities, you might imagine that almost any card will help someone.
Although the suspense can be frustrating, just imagine your joy when your
draw comes in and you scoop a big pot. But the river can be treacherous, and
here are some tips for navigating it safely.
d
U/hen you make the best high hand
If you have the best high hand after all the cards have been dealt, you can bet
or raise without fear. You are assured of capturing at least half the pot, and
may scoop it if there is no low.
113
i
j
i
This is the time to be aggressive. Get as much of your opponent’s money in
the pot as you can; at least half of it will come back to you.

Part I: Howto Play the Games
When you have the best Iou1 hand
cjABE#
Having the best low hand is not as simple as holding the best high hand. If
you are absolutely sure you have the only nut low, you can bet or raise just
as if you have the best high hand. But if one of your opponents has the same
hand — and this is very common in Omaha/8— you will be quartered.
Making money when this happens is difficult. You need at least five players in
the pot to show a profit, and it won’t be much of a profit at that.
Suppose that five of you each have $20 in the pot. If you are quartered for
low, you and the other low hand will each receive $25— a scant $5 profit on
your investment. The high hand will take $50, for a profit of $30.
If you have a two-way hand, you can be aggressive with it, particularly if you
know you have the best hand in one direction. In the $20 per-player example,
you would have won $100, for a net profit of $80, if you were able to scoop
the pot.
That’s why Omaha/8 and other split games are somewhat slippery slopes.
Scooping the pot is not merely twice as good as winning one side of the con-
frontation — the win is usually much better than that.

Exploring Omaha High-Only
Omaha is not necessarily a high-low split game; you can play it as a high-only
game, too. You’ll find Omaha played as a high-only game in some casinos,
although it is not nearly as popular as its 8-or-Better cousin.
ajtfNG/
Omaha High-Only is often played pot-limit in card casinos. Betting can esca-
late extremely quickly in these games, and the last thing we’d ever advise a
V^PJ
beginning player is to play pot-limit or no-limit poker
Much of the time, Omaha High-Only makes an appearance during a major
poker tournament — the kind that takes place over a week or longer — and
the game is usually played as pot-limit.
Omaha High-Only is very popular in European card casinos, but in England,
Ireland, and much of continental Europe, pot-limit games are the rule rather
than the exception.
The mechanics of Omaha High are identical to those of Omaha/8. Each player
receives four cards in his starting hand. After a round of betting, three com-
munal cards are flopped. A betting round, a fourth communal card, and
another round of betting follows. Then a fifth community card is placed on the
board. A final betting round follows and the best five-card hand wins the pot.
As in Omaha/8, a player must use precisely two cards from her hand and com-
bine them with three of the community cards to form her best poker hand.
So far, so good. Everything looks the same. But if you play Omaha High-Only,
you can expect some major differences in strategy.
u* Ditch low hands: Because low hands won’t win a thing in this game, why
play low cards? A hand like A-2-3-4 is a powerhouse in Omaha/8, because
it can easily make the best low hand and capture half the pot. But this
low hand is a real dog in Omaha when it’s a high-only game.
v* Mid-range is okay: In Omaha/8, you rarely play a hand like 9-8-7-6. If you
make the best possible straight, you probably have to give up half the pot
to a better low hand, and if you make the lower end of a straight, such as
8-9-10-J-Q, you face a very good chance that someone has a bigger
straight. But if you’re playing for high only, you never have to worry about
a lower hand snatching half the pot out from under your nose.
Wrap it: When played for high, Omaha is often a game of straights and
flushes. Because each player is dealt four private cards that can com-
bine to form six distinctly different two-card combinations. Making a
straight or a flush is not quite the rarity it is in Texas Hold’em, where
each player has only one two-card combination to work with. Wherever
there is a possible straight due to the array of communal cards, an
Omaha hand is much more likely to have the right two-card combination
than a Hold’em hand.

Part I: How to Play the Games
Of course, whenever the board is paired, someone may have a full house
or four-of-a-kind. But beyond those possibilities, straights and flushes
are the name of the game. No one can possibly make a flush without
three community cards of the same suit. That’s where wraps come into
play. If you have four sequenced cards, or four cards with a small gap,
you can make a straight in any number of ways. Here’s an example of a
hand that requires “wrappped” attention.
In Omaha, you can have as many as 20 opportunities to make a straight.
If you began with J-l0-7-6 and the flop was 9-8-3, you’d make a straight
with a queen, jack, 10, 7, 6, or 5. Four of those cards are in your hand,
but with two more board cards to be dealt, you can expect to complete a
|j
straight more than 70 percent of the time. By comparison, in Texas
|
Hold’em the maximum number of cards you can have that will complete
5
your straight is eight.
I J* Big flushes: If you’re going to make a flush, you may as well think big.
|
There’s nothing more frustrating than making a flush and losing to a
;
bigger one. For obvious reasons, you’d much rather make a straight with
I
a hand like 9-S-7-6 than a flush.
You may want to introduce Omaha High-Only as well as Omaha/8 into your
home games to see which version you prefer. But if you’re in a poker club or
casino, you won’t have the luxury of becoming acquainted with a game
before you enter serious play The best way to learn Omaha High-Only under
these circumstances is to find an inexpensive tournament. Even if the tourna-
ment event is pot limit, you can afford to play and learn as long as the cost to
enter the tourney is within your poker budget.

Setting up a successful home game
Choosing the type of game
Deciphering poker etiquette
H
ome poker games have been around forever. A good home poker game
gives you something to look forward to with friends and colleagues.
This chapter gives you advice on home games and how to set one up
successfully.
Setting Up a Home Game
A successful ongoing home poker game requires good planning and well-
thought-out rules. The key to a good game, of course, is a friendly, fair game
that people will want to keep coming back to on a regular basis.
This section shows you some key considerations for establishing a fair and
fun game.
i
1
Rules
A good home game has rules established well before the game begins to
avoid any controversy. Try to follow the rules that normally apply in card
clubs and casinos so as to not confuse people who play in both.
Your rules should encompass answers to at least the following questions:
1 u* Is checkraising allowed?
I i* How will antes be put up? By each player or only by the dealer?
118
Part l; How to Play the Games
v0 What is the best low hand? (The great majority of card clubs say that
A-2-3-4-5 is the best low, even though it’s a straight.)
is* If you play a high-low game, how will the parties declare their hand?
(Chips in the hand is the most common method.)
^ In a high-low game, if one person goes both ways, what happens if he
ties one way?
t*0 Who splits the pot if a player going both ways wins only one way?
v0 What constitutes a misdeal?
v0 What happens if there is a misdeal?
If the pot is split up between two players, who gets any odd chip?
Think about putting your rules on paper. Memories fade as to what was agreed
upon, so it’s helpful to bring out the rules in the event of any controversy.
beater's choice
Many home games involve a variety of poker games, but dealers choice is
usually the deciding factor on the actual game to be played. That is, the
dealer can choose the game she wishes to play for that hand or for a round.
The dealer may also designate any special rules such as:
I v0 Whether there will be a high-low split.
I ^
0 Whether the betting will increase in certain instances.
|v0 Whether there is a wild card.
I
Whether there is a bet or not after there is a “declare” of low or high in
1
split games.
Of course, the dealer’s decisions should be reasonable. You can’t have a
situation where the rules unduly favor the dealer.

Chapter 7:Home Poker Games
Betting stakes
The betting stakes for a home game need to be agreed on clearly in advance.
On the one hand, you want the stakes to be meaningful — enough to keep up
people’s interest and to allow bluffing and other strategies to potentially be
effective. But on the other hand, you don’t want the stakes to be so high that
players can lose a very large sum in one night. Huge swings can ultimately kill
a game, as people will drop off for fear that they can’t continue sustaining sig-
nificant losses.
IK
Some games allow an increase in the stakes in certain poker games or in the
last hour of the game.
But remember, a home game is also often about camaraderie and friendship,
so if you are going to err on betting stakes, err on the low side.
Wild cards
Most poker purists play without wild cards, but some games do incorporate
wild cards. A wild card is specified by the dealer and can be used to greatly
improve a hand. So, if you are playing with a wild card or cards, you have to
expect the hands to be better than those in regular poker. Gauge your betting
accordingly.
The typical choices for wild cards are:
u* Joker The joker can be used as any card or, alternatively, for only aces,
straights and flushes.
v* Deuces: Each 2 card is wild. So a hand consisting of 4-4-2-2-J is 4-4-4-4-J.
v* One-eyed jacks: The jack of spades and jack of hearts have only one eye
each, and these jacks when played as wild cards can be any card you wish.
Our preference is to play without wild cards. Wild cards introduce a high ele-
ment of luck. So if you are a great poker player, you don’t want to introduce a
greater luck component in your game that your opponents can benefit from.

Time limit
Before the game starts, set a time when the game will end and stick to it. By
setting the time limit, everyone is on notice and whining can be avoided by
people who are losing and want to continue playing past a reasonable hour.
Near the end, it’s often appropriate for the host of the game to announce that
the time is drawing near and that three more hands or one more round will
end the game. That warning enables players to plan their end strategy
accordingly.
Food and drinks
The host for the game should arrange for appropriate food and drinks in
advance. Here is our favorite poker food:
u* Chips and dip
Pizza
v* Pigs in a blanket
v* Licorice
v0 Cashews
u* Beer and soda
Don’t get any of that frou-frou stuff like salads and broccoli. If you do, you
should suffer humiliating comments from your friends.
Reimbursing the host for all of the expenses in getting the food and drinks is
also appropriate. This is best accomplished by taking a few dollars from each
pot until the right amount is set aside.
Paying up
The rules should clearly set forth in advance as to how the losers will pay
and the winners compensated.The key issues to address are:
I v0 Will payment be in cash or check?
I
Will payment be at the end of the night or at the next game?
Chapter 7:Home Poker Games
Game Options
Home games typically have more game options than card clubs or casinos.
The type of games is limited only by the imagination of the players. This
section describes a number of the most common home games.
SeVen-Card Stud
Seven-Card Stud is very popular and can be played high-only or high-low.
Two down cards and one up card is first dealt to each player. Four more
cards are dealt, three up, and the last one down, with betting intervals follow- ,
ing each card. From the seven cards played, the best five cards win. Head
over to Chapter 3 for a detailed description of the game.
Texas Hold'em
In Hold’em, each player receives two cards face down, and then a bet ensues.
Then three common cards are dealt face up, followed by a common fourth
and a common fifth card, with betting intervals. The best five cards out of the
two in your hand and the five on the board constitutes the hand. See Chapter
4 for details and great tips.
Omaha Hiqh
In Omaha High, each player gets four cards face down, and then a bet occurs.
Then three cards are dealt face up all at once on the board as common cards,
with a betting round. Then a fourth common card is dealt face up with a bet,
with a betting round, and a fifth common card is dealt face up with a common
card and with a betting round. A player must use two (and only two cards)
from his hand, together with three of the common cards. Hands in Omaha
tend to be higher than those in Seven Stud or Hold’em because of the greater
number of cards dealt out and the greater number of possibilities. Check out
Chapter 6 for some terrific tips on Omaha.
Omaha High-Lou?, 8-or-Better
Omaha High-Low, 8-or-Better (Omaha/8) is played in the same way as Omaha
(four cards in your hand, five common cards ultimately on the board), but
there is a high hand and a low hand that splits the pot. A qualifying hand of 8
or better is needed for a hand to be in contention to win half of the pot.
Check out Chapter 6 for advice on playing this game.

PartI: How to Play the Games
Pineapple
Pineapple starts with three cards dealt face down to each player, and then a
betting round ensues. Then three common cards are dealt face up followed
by a betting round. Then each player must discard one of the cards in his
hand. Then a fourth common card is dealt face up followed by betting, fol-
lowed by a fifth common card face up and then betting. The best five cards
from the two in your hand and five on the board are played. Pineapple can
also be played high-low.
Five-Card braW
In Five-Card Draw poker, each player is dealt five cards face down. After the
deal, a betting round occurs. After the betting round, beginning with the
player on the dealer’s left, a player may discard one or more cards, and the
dealer then deals her from the deck as many cards as she has discarded (the
draw). A player does not have to draw and can stay pat. (For example, if you
already have a straight, flush, or full house, you should stay pat and not draw
any cards.)
After the draw, there is another betting round, followed by the show of
hands. Some games limit the number of cards that can be drawn, some not.
In one variation of Five-Card Draw, a person is allowed to bet only if she has a
pair of jacks or better.
Lowball
Lowball is like Five-Card Draw, but the lowest hand wins the pot. Ace always
counts as a low card and A-2-3-4-5 is the best possible low. Straights and
flushes don’t count, although some players play that 6-4-3-2-A is the lowest
hand.
Like Five-Card Draw, five cards are dealt face down, followed by a betting
round. Then a player may discard cards to improve his hand, followed by a
final betting round.
The best hand is referred to by the highest card in your hand. If two players
have the same card that is the highest card, then the next lowest card counts.
For example,
7-6-54-2 beats 8-64-3-2
7-5-4-2-A beats 7-64-3-A
6-5-3-2-A beats 6-5-4-2-A
Chapter 7:Home Poker Games
No pair beats any pair. So even K-10-9-8-7 Beats 2-2-3-4-5.
Lowball is typically a game that should be played conservatively, waiting for
pat hands or hands with one-card draws.
Fii/e-Card Stud
In Five-Card Stud, each player gets one card down and one card up initially,
followed by a bet. Then each player gets a second up card, followed by a bet.
A third and fourth card face up is given to each player, each followed by a
bet.
The best high hand at the end wins. There are variations of the game where
players are allowed to buy one or two replacement cards after all five cards
are dealt. The game can also be played high-low, although in this variation, no
minimum 8-low-or better is typically required.
A high pair in regular Five-Card Stud can often win the hand.
Baseball
Baseball is typically a version of Seven-Card Stud, where each player gets two
cards down, four cards dealt face up, and a final card face down. But in
Baseball, all 9s and 3s are wild. If a 4 is dealt face up, it entitles the player to
an extra down card.
Baseball is a game where big, big hands often come up. With eight wild cards,
you can see four of a kind easily, with straight flushes and five of a kind hap-
pening not infrequently.
Black Mariah
Black Mariah (sometimes referred to as Chicago) is a Seven-Card Stud game,
except that the high spade in the hole splits half the pot. Sometimes Q*
counts as the highest spade.
If you have the highest spade in the hole in the first two cards you get, you
can keep betting and raising at will.

Indian Poker
Indian Poker is a one-card game dealt face down to each player. Each player,
without looking at his card, simultaneously places it on his forehead so that
other player can see all cards but his own. Then there is a single round of bet-
ting, and then a showdown.
Razz is Seven-Card Stud, played low. Each player starts with two cards down
and one card up. Each player must ante initially, and the high card on the
board is typically required to make a small bet. Subsequent players may then
call or raise.
As long as he stays in, a player gets ultimately a total of three hole cards and
four exposed up cards. The best hand is A-2-3-4-5. The key to this game is
starting with three low cards and being able to read your opponents’ hands
and remember what cards have been already played and folded.
Crisscross (or Iron Cross )
Five cards are dealt to each player face down. Then five cards are placed face
down on the board as common cards, in two intersecting rows forming a
crisscross arrangement. The common cards are revealed clockwise, with the
center card last, and with betting after each exposed card.
Two cards from a player’s hand and one row from the crisscross are used.
The game can be played high-only or high-low.
Poker Etiquette in Home Games
Basic etiquette plays a vital role in society, and it even applies to poker.
Players who are rude and inconsiderate may soon find themselves excluded
from games or the object of silent derision. We’re not saying you need to
stick a doily under your beer or soda bottle, but keep the following do’s and
don’ts in mind.

luffing is poker’s magic elixir. It’s the sleight of hand where high art and
drama reside. It’s the place where myths are made. After all, what’s a
western movie without a poker scene with one player trying to bluff another
out of a big pot?
To those who do not play poker or who have only a nodding acquaintance
with it, bluffing is where those folks focus most of their attention when they
think about the game.
What Is Bluffing, Anyu/ay?
Ask most poker players to define bluffing and they’ll tell you about betting a
weak hand with the hope of driving other players out of the pot. After all,
without bluffing, poker would be a boring game. Bets would be made and the

But some players win most of the time and some players lose most of the
time. And it’s often bluffing — or more precisely the possibility that one’s
adversary might be bluffing— that goes a long way toward separating the
winners from the losers. Bluffing, after all, is merely a form of deception —
and deception is an essential component in winning poker.
After all, if your opponents always knew what cards you had they’d be tough
to beat. Deception is the art of keeping others off balance. Like a misdirection
play in football, or a baseball player hitting behind the runner into an area
vacated by the infielder on a hit-and-run play, deception is a required skill for
any poker player.
different Kinds Of Bluffs
Bluffing comes in several forms— the reason for bluffing frequently depends
on the cards you hold, what you think your opponents have in their hands,
and what you think they believe you have.
Betting— or raising — with a helpless hand. With this technique, you
have a weak hand but act as if it’s a strong one. The maneuver is
reversible, too: You can act weak when holding an extremely powerful
hand in order to lure opponents into a trap.
I u* Betting or raising on the inexpensive betting rounds. You use this bluff
I
in order to get a free card later on in the hand — when the cost of bets
I
double.
I u* Betting with a semi-bluff. Noted poker theorist David Sklansky, who
j
coined the term, defines the semi-bluff as “ . . . a bet with a hand which,
|
if called, does not figure to be the best hand at the moment but has a
t
reasonable chance of outdrawing those hands that initially called it.”
Chapter 8: Bluffing
With a semi-bluff, as opposed to a bluff with a helpless hand, a player
has two ways to win:
• His opponent might think the bluffer has the hand he’s represent-
ing and release his own hand.
• If the opponent calls, the bluffer might catch the card he needs and
beat his opponent that way.
The Importance of Bluffing
Some players — and it’s only a few of them, to be sure — never bluff. After ,
you figure out who they are, playing against them is easy. If they bet once all
the cards are out, you can safely throw your hand away unless you believe
that your hand is superior to theirs. If it is, you should raise.

Part II: Advanced Strategy
Other people are habitual bluffers. When they bet, you have to call as long as
you are holding any reasonable hand. Although habitual bluffers will also
make real hands every now and then, the fact that they bluff far too often
makes your decision easy. By calling, you’ll win far more money in the long
run than you would save by folding.
Keep'em guessing
fa
We have no easy answer about players who bluff some, but not all of the
time. Opponents who bluff some of the time are better poker players than
those found at either end of the bluffing spectrum. Better players, of course,
can keep you guessing about whether or not they are bluffing. And when
you’re forced to guess, you will be wrong some of the time. That’s just the
way it is.
Of course, you might be able to pick up a tell (a revealing gesture) and know
when your opponent is bluffing, but that’s not too likely in most cases. The
sad truth is that players who keep you guessing are going to give you much
more trouble than predictable opponents.
In most low-limit games, players bluff much too often. After all, when you
play fixed-limit poker, all it costs is one additional bet to see someone’s hand.
And the pots are usually big enough, relative to the size of a bet, to make call-
ing the right decision.
Here’s an example: Suppose the pot contains $90, and your opponent makes
a $10 bet. That pot now contains $100, and the cost of your call is only $10.
Even if you figure your opponent to be bluffing only one time in ten, you
should call. By calling, the laws of probability suggest that you’d lose a $10
bet nine times, for a loss of $90. Although you’d win only once, that pot
would be worth $100. After ten such occurrences, you’d show a net profit of
$10. As a result, you could say that regardless of the outcome of any particu-
lar hand, each call was worth one dollar to you.
•
The threat of bluffing
The threat of a bluff is just as important as a bluff itself. A good player — one
who bluffs neither too often nor too infrequently, and seems to do so under
the right conditions — has something else going for her too. It’s the threat of
a bluff. Does she have the goods or is she bluffing? How can you tell? If you
can’t, how do you know what to do when she bets?
Chapter 8:Bluffing
These answers don’t come easily, and even top-notch players are not going to
have a terrific batting average in most cases. As a result, the threat of a bluff
combined with the bluff itself, is designed to help a player win some pots that
she would otherwise lose and to win more money in pots where she actually
has the best hand.
After all, if you have the best hand and come out betting, your opponent
won’t always know whether you’re bluffing or not. If there’s a lot of money in
the pot, she’ll probably call.That’s the less costly error. After all, if she were
to throw the winning hand away and relinquish a big pot, that’s a much more
costly faux pas than calling one additional bet.
Bluffing and the threat of bluffing go hand in hand. A bluff can enable a player
to win a pot she figured to lose if the hands were shown down. The threat of a
bluff enables a player with a good hand to win more money than she would if
her opponent knew she never bluffed.
The Bluffing Paradox
A successful poker player has to adopt a middle-ground strategy. This means
that sometimes you’ll be called when you bluffed and lose that bet. Other
times you will release the best hand because an opponent successfully
bluffed you out of the pot.
Neither scenario is enjoyable. Just remember that making errors is inevitable
ffX
when you deal with incomplete information. One can call too often or not
|jjj I
enough. One can bluff too often or not at all. And the only way to eliminate
errors at one extreme is to commit them at the other.
Very cautious players, who never call unless certain of winning, avoid calling
with a lesser hand, but often relinquish a pot they would have won. Players
who call all the time win just about every pot they can possibly win, but
find themselves holding the short straw far too often when the hands are
shown down.
The paradox is that good players make both kinds of errors some of the time
to avoid being a predictable player at either end of the bluffing-calling spec-
trum. After all, there’s a relationship between risk and reward. If you are
never caught bluffing, you are either the best bluffer in the history of poker
or you are not bluffing often enough. If you are caught almost every time you
bluff, you’re bluffing much too frequently.
If you call all the time, you will never lose a pot you could have won, and if
you seldom call, your opponents will learn that they can win by betting and
driving you off the pot unless you have a very strong hand.
Bluffing, after all, is much like mom’s advice: “All things in moderation.”

Not Alt Bluffs Are Created Equal
Not all bluffs are the same. Some work better in one situation that others, so
let’s look at the various kinds of bluffs and distinguish between them.
Bluffing on the end With a hopeless hand
This is the classic bluff of movie lore. You’re up against an opponent or
possibly two of them. You have a hopeless hand. Perhaps it’s a straight draw
that didn’t materialize. Maybe it’s a busted flush draw.

never bluffed at all.

'
If the hands were to be shown down, you know you couldn’t possibly win. So
you bet. “Nothing ventured,” you think to yourself , “nothing gained,” If some-
one calls your bluff, you lose a bet you would have saved had you checked.
But checking, of course, is tantamount to relinquishing your opportunity to
win the pot.
If you bet, there’s always the chance that both your opponents will fold. If
someone doesn’t call you, then you win the entire pot. Suppose that pot con-
tains $100 and the cost to bet is $10. Your bluff doesn’t have to succeed all of
the time — or even most of the time — for it to be a good decision.
If bluffing fails nine times and succeeds only once, you will still be a winner in
the long run. You’ll have lost an extra $10 nine times, or $90, but you will win
$100 on one occasion, for a net win of $10. That net figure may not be a spec-
tacular profit, perhaps, but enough to prove that bluffs have to succeed only
every now and then to be worthwhile.
Bluffing With more cards to come
When you bluff with more cards to come, you usually have two ways to win.
The bluff might succeed on its own merits, causing an opponent to lay down
the best hand. In addition, you might catch the card you need on a succeed-
ing round and actually make the winning hand.
Imagine that you’re playing Hold’em and you raised before the flop with
KvQv , and two other players call. Suppose the flop is J*6v4v . If you come
out betting on the flop, you have any number of ways to win this pot. Your
opponents could fold, and you’d win right there. But even if one or both call,
you certainly shouldn’t mind. After all, any of the nine hearts in the deck can
complete your flush. Moreover, any of the three kings or three queens will

give you a pair that is probably superior to whatever your opponents are
holding. In addition, there are three tens in the deck (exclusive of the lOv ,
which completes your flush) that will give you a straight draw.
A lot of good cards are in that deck, and you are rife with potential. When you
couple the chances of making the best hand on the turn or the river with the
possibility that your adversaries will fold if you bet, you are probably an
odds-on favorite to win the pot one way or another.
Bluffing and Position
In most instances, acting last — after you’ve had a chance to see what your
opponents do— is a big advantage. But when you’re bluffing it’s often advan-
tageous to act first.
Chapter 8: Bluffing
/3^
i
If your opponent checks and you bet, he’s likely to realize that you are trying
to take advantage of the fact that he’s shown weakness. As a result, he is
more likely to call — or even raise, if he’s a very aggressive player — with
marginal hands.
But betting from first position conveys the image that you really do have a
strong hand. After all, you are betting into someone who could have a really
powerful hand. Your opponent, of course, will realize that and be more prone
to release a marginal hand than he would be if he checked and then you bet.
(For more details about position, see Chapter 3.)
Bluffing More Than One Opponent
The odds against a bluff succeeding increase significantly as you add addi-
tional opponents to the equation. The more opponents, the more someone is
likely to call to keep you from winning a sizeable pot by bluffing. “1 had to call
to keep you honest” is a frequently heard expression at any poker table.
Suppose you were facing a single opponent and thought that your bluff would
succeed one-third of the time. Those aren’t bad odds, particularly when the
money in the pot exceeds the odds against a successful bluff. Suppose the
pot contains $90 and the price of a bet is $30. If this situation were to repeat
itself and your estimate of successfully bluffing was accurate, you would bet
$30 twice and lose, but you’d win $90 the third time. In the long run, this is an
opportunity with a positive expected value.
But what happens if you add a third player to the mix? Once again, you figure
that your chances of successfully bluffing the additional player are one
chance in three. The presence of a third player will, of course, increase the
size of the pot. Let’s assume that the pot now contains $135.

Part II: Advanced Strategy
Although the size of the pot has increased arithmetically, the chances against
your bluff succeeding can be argued to have grown geometrically
While the size of the pot increased, it usually does not increase to a point
where it offsets the very long odds against successfully bluffing through two
opponents.
m
Bluffs work best against a small number of opponents. The fewer the better.
Three is almost always too many, and even running a bluff through two play-
ers is both daunting and difficult. There is one exception, however. Assume
that there are no more cards to come. If you are first to act and are facing two
opponents, you can bluff if you think that the last player to act was on a draw
and missed her hand.
Suppose you are playing Hold’em and there are two suited cards on the flop.
If Phyllis, the third opponent, simply calls on the flop and the turn, chances
are she may have had a flush draw that never materialized. If that’s the case,
she is very likely to release her hand against a bet on the river, even if she
suspects that you’re bluffing. When all is said and done, she might not even
be able to beat a bluff.

Chapter 8: Bluffing
But Stan, the player in the middle, has a lot to worry about. If you bet, not only
does he have to worry about whether you have a real hand, he also needs to
concern himself with the player to his left. Even if the player in the middle has
a marginal hand — the kind he’d call you with if the two of you were heads-
up— he might release it. After all, Stan has two concerns: Your hand might be
stronger than his, and the third player might also have a better hand.
When your opponent in the middle is a good player — good enough to release
a marginal hand rather than stubbornly call “ . . . to keep you honest” — you
might use the implied threat of the third adversary to force the man in the
middle to shed his holding.
Bluffing Strategies
Bluffing is tricky business. You never know for sure if you’ll be called or if you’ll
be able to steal a pot out from under your opponent’s nose. The next time
you’re inclined to perform larceny at the poker table, keep these tips in mind:
I ^ Be aware of how many players you’ll have to bluff your way through.
While one or even two players can be bluffed, don’t think about trying to
;;
bluff more than two opponents unless you really have strong reasons to
believe you’ll succeed.

decision. After all, you’re usually just risking one bet to win an entire pot

choice. And even when you’re caught, a bluff can be successful if it

I ^
0 Avoid bluffing players who are either experts or brain dead. Instead,
aim your bluffs at good opponents. Poor players will usually call “ . .. to
keep you honest,” while experts are more likely to see through your
I
chicanery.
I is0 Don’t bluff for the sake of bluffing. Some players will bluff just to
I
“advertise.” There’s no need to do that. Bluff if you believe you have a
reasonable chance to succeed. You’ll get plenty of advertising value
;
because some of your bluffs will be picked off regardless of how well you
f
assess your chances for success.
|v0 Never bluff a hopeless hand when there are more cards to come.
|
Instead, think about semi-bluffing, which allows you to win the pot two
ways: Your opponents may fold, or you might hit your draw. (See the
section “Bluffing with more cards to come” in this chapter.)
I
Take the opportunity to bluff if all of your opponents check on the
|
previous betting round. It’s even better if they’ve all checked on an
|
expensive betting round. But your chances are diminished if any newly

Part
Advanced Strategy
Imply specific hands. Bluffs that seem to represent specific hands, such
as a flush or a straight, have a much better chance to succeed than bets
that appear to come out of the blue.
Zero in on weak players. It’s much easier to bluff players who have
shown weakness by checking, than to bluff those who have shown
strength by betting on the preceding round.
Strive for a tight, aggressive image by playing the kinds of starting
hands recommended in this book. This kind of image has a much better
chance of running a successful bluff than a player with a loose image. If
you are seen as selective, tight, and aggressive, your opponents will not
suspect a bluff when you bet. When you have a license to steal, use it.
v* Attempt a bluff occasionally when all the cards are out and you have
nothing, but don’t overdo it. But if you have enough to beat a draw,
save that additional bet and try to win in a showdown.

M M Id paradigms, like old soldiers, never die. Some never even fade away.
At one time, people believed the Earth was flat and the sun revolved
around it. Some of us still “knock wood,” whistle when walking past a grave-
yard, avoid walking under ladders, believe black cats are bad luck, and
patiently await the next harmonic convergence. Others— poker players,
mostly — are enamored with the idea of money management.
What Is Money Management Anyutay?
Money management is one of those concepts that should have died long ago
but didn’t and still makes its way into far too much gaming literature. Part of
the definition, the up side, is based on the timeless adage, “Quit while you’re
ahead.” After you win a predetermined amount, get up from that poker table
and leave the game a bit richer and happier than you were when you walked in.
1
U 2
Part II: Advanced Strategy
The down side tells you not to lose more than a predetermined amount (a
stop-loss limit) at any one session. (See the section “Should you quit while
you’re ahead?” in this chapter.) Once you’ve reached your money limit, it’s
time to quit. “Give it up and go home,” say the high priests of money manage-
ment, “you won’t make it back that day. Come back tomorrow Lady Luck cold-
shouldered you, and you ought to know better than to chase your losses.”
Does money management make sense >
Consider these questions:
1 v* Does following a money-management plan make any sense?
1
Is it correct to quit while you’re ahead?
S v0 Should you quit once you’ve lost some predetermined amount?
i
If you quit when you’re ahead, as well as when you’re losing, should you
play only when your results are contained within the boundaries of your
stop-loss limit on the negative side, and a stop-win point if you’ve had a
I
fortunate day?
Even money-management adherents usually agree that a poker game theoreti-
cally never ends (at least in card clubs), and it makes no difference whether
you play four hours today and four hours tomorrow, or play eight hours just
today. If that’s the case, what is the logic behind money-management theories?
Should you quit while you're ahead?
If you take the quit-while-you’re-ahead approach, proponents say, you get to
take your profit out of the game and not give back money you’ve already won.
If you think about it, though, this makes sense only if you decide to quit
poker entirely. If you know you’ll never play again and you’re ahead in today’s
game, then quitting does allow you to permanently put today’s profit into
your pocket.
But if you quit as a winner today and lose tomorrow, are you any worse off
than if you simply played on and lost what you had won earlier in the ses-
sion? The answer, quite obviously, is no. You’re not worse off; you simply
pocketed those winnings for a few more hours.
If you are only an occasional player, then walking away as a winner may be
the wise move so that you have some extra cash to spend.
Chapter 9:Money Management and Recordkeeping U3
Should you quit when you reach a
stop-loss limit?
Leave the game if you are losing (taking the stop-loss approach); ask yourself
whether you plan to play tomorrow— or even next week, for that matter. If
you answer “yes,” then ask yourself if you think you can win. If you plan to
play again and believe you can win, is there any real difference between quit-
ting now or continuing to play?
If you regularly play in a game where you are not a favorite, you can expect to
lose money — and it makes no difference whether or not you practice money
management. If you are a favorite, however, playing makes sense regardless
of whether you are ahead or behind at any given moment.
The Truth About Money Management
Here’s the only facet of money management that’s true: If the game is good
and you are a favorite to win, you probably ought to continue playing. If the
game is bad and you are an underdog, quit! Never mind whether you’re win-
ning or losing.
Of course, a game can be terrific and you may not be a favorite for any
number of reasons unrelated to skill. You may be tired; upset because you
argued with your spouse, kids, or boss; physically ill and not able to concen-
trate; or stressed out from work, freeway gridlock, or any other assault on the
sanctity of the human condition that might put you off your best game.
You’ll save lots of money over the course of your poker-playing career by fol-
lowing this simple rule: If you’re not playing at your best, go home. If you quit
the game, it will still be there tomorrow, but if you stay too long at the dance,
your money might be gone.
Having a positive expectation
Tg
Consider this: Gambling successfully is predicated on putting yourself into
situations where you have a positive expectation. That’s why there aren’t any
professional craps or roulette players. In the long run, there is no chance of
winning when the odds are not in your favor. Any reasonably skilled poker
player can find games where he or she is favored to win. While favorites can
and do get beaten, they show a profit in the end.

Game selection and money management
One of the key concepts to winning at any form of poker is game selection, so
why would you voluntarily take yourself out of a good game simply because
you have won or lost some arbitrarily predetermined amount of money? If
you’ve suffered a number of bad beats (hands where you had the best of it
until someone caught a miracle card to beat you) and nothing seems to be
going right, you might want to quit even though the game is good. Quitting is
okay in that case — but only if you can’t assure yourself that you’ll continue
to play to the best of your ability.
Never quit just because you’ve reached a stop-loss limit.
What if you’re in a good game and you’re $1,000 ahead? Should you really
quit when you’re ahead? If the game is that good and you have no other
pressing commitments, why not keep on playing? After all, you’re a favorite.
Chances are you’ll win even more money.
But whether you win or lose from that point on, your future results are
always up for grabs, regardless of whether you keep playing or pack it in and
return to the game tomorrow. The game goes on, and the segments of time
during which you’re playing are only arbitrary measures.
Chapter 9:Money Management and Recordkeeping
The Importance of Keeping Records
If you don’t keep records, how do you know if you’re successful or not?
Without accurate records, you never know how good a player you are. Many
poker players— even good ones — don’t keep accurate records.
\
If you are serious about poker, treat your game like a business or a profes-
sion. Every business keeps records. Without them, a business owner has no
idea of what it costs to make, sell, or inventory product, and no way of know-
ing whether his or her bottom line is written in black or red.
Perhaps it’s easier for the majority of poker players who don’t keep records
to avoid looking truth in the face. But if you plan to win money when playing
poker, you must be aware of the results you’re achieving.
Fortunately, the kind of records you need to keep as a poker player are a lot
simpler than the records that business owners have to keep.
What kind of records should I keep )
Every poker player should be concerned about two basic statistical measures:
Win rate indicates how much money you’re winning— or losing—
aggregated on an hourly basis.
u* Standard deviation measures short-term fluctuations. Standard
deviation measures variance — or luck. Good luck or bad; it makes no
difference in this equation.
HoW to keep records
You don’t need to be a statistician to keep these records. In fact, you can do
this without knowing anything more than grade school arithmetic. It’s easy.
The next time you play poker, take along a small notebook and record the
amount of money you use to buy into the game. Then record the following
information on an hourly basis:
Amount won or lost during the previous hour
v* The game you’re playing in (for example, $2-$4 Hold’em)
v* Total number of hours played that session
Jt)6
Part II: Advanced Strategy
When you get home, you can add the preceding information to your record of
previous sessions so that you have cumulative statistics, as well as a record
of how well you did each time you played.
Go ahead and calculate
v* The amount won or lost for the entire year.
v* The total number of hours played during the year.
Keeping up u/ith recordkeeping
j
One of the psychologically difficult things about keeping records is simply
keeping up with it. After a tough loss, it can be very difficult to record that
loss in your record book and have it stare you in the face each time you
glance that way. Nevertheless, if you don’t keep records, you’ll only delude
yourself about the results you’ve achieved at the table.
If you are playing just for enjoyment and don’t care whether you win or lose,
then, excuse yourself from the drudgery. If you are a winning player, or aspire
to be one, you must record and analyze your results.
Hou) to Figure\lourWin Rate
Computing your win or loss rate is simple: Divide the amount of money won
or lost by the number of hours you’ve played.
This calculation shows you the average amount won or lost per hour played. In
statistics, that figure is called the mean. If you play in different games, you might
want to keep records on a game-by-game basis (to determine whether you’re
doing better at Hold’em, Lowball, or Omaha) as well as on an overall basis.
Alt averages are not created equal
Knowing how much you are winning or losing on an hourly basis is impor-
tant. But it is also important to know whether the mean is representative. In
other words, is the mean a good indicator of the data it represents?
If this concept seems confusing, here’s an example to clear things up. Let’s
say San Francisco and Omaha each have an average annual temperature of
65°F. But San Francisco rarely gets very warm or very cold, while Omaha is
very hot in the summer and bitterly cold in winter. While the mean tempera-
ture might be the same for both cities, there is greater variability in Omaha
Chapter 9:Money Management and Recordkeeping
than in San Francisco. San Francisco’s average temperature of 65°F is more
representative, because it’s probably closer to the actual temperature on
most days than it would be in Omaha.
In poker, two players might win an average of $15 per hour. One of these play-
ers might be very aggressive and win large sums of money some days and
lose quite a bit on others. A more conservative player might have more
modest winning days — and more modest losing days, too. Both of these
players, however, could have the same average.
The player who can achieve that win rate while putting less of his money at
risk is better off. To measure these fluctuations, you need to know more
about those observed values (the amount you won or lost each hour and
recorded in your notebook) that were used to calculate your average wins or
losses. Once you know that, you can easily measure just how well the mean
represents those observed values. That measure helps describe the mean —
that’s where standard deviation comes in.
Standard deviation (or the mathematically
challenged
If you haven’t taken a class in statistics, the term standard deviation might
seem awfully frightening and foreboding. It’s not, because you’re about to dis-
cover a very easy way to calculate your standard deviation. After all, stan-
dard deviation is simply a way of indicating a typical amount by which all the
values deviate, or vary, from the mean.
Think of the standard deviation as though it were an adjective modifying a
noun (your hourly win rate).
Here’s an example: “She’s wearing a dress.” Dress, of course, is the noun. You
can modify that sentence by adding any one of the following adjectives:
“She’s wearing a (blue, businesslike, grandmotherly, revealing, designer,
hideous) dress. See how substituting one adjective for another can radically
change the meaning of that sentence? It’s much the same with the relation-
ship between the standard deviation and the mean.
Before we begin playing with examples, think about your own style of poker-
play, and whether it encourages or discourages dramatic fluctuations. In
other words, are you a gambler?
Do you usually have big swings from session to session, and are you happy
with it? There’s no right or wrong answer. Each player has an inherent
amount of risk he or she is willing to tolerate. By monitoring their standard
deviations as well as the average amount won per hour, players can choose
to slightly reduce their hourly average winnings while substantially reducing
their fluctuations.

would deviate from the mean. If, for example, it was exactly 72°F for six days
in a row, the mean temperature would be 72 degrees for that period, and
there would be no variance between high and low. Observed values usually
deviate from the mean— some by a little, others by a lot.
Which of these sets of values would you expect to have a larger standard
deviation?

(The right answer is Column A, and we show you why.)
Calculating the standard deviation
The values in Column A are more dispersed (they deviate more from the
mean of 36) than those in Column B (with a mean of 116), so we can expect
the standard deviation to be larger in Column A. Take a look at how this
works out:
Column A

(Each Deviation column indicates the difference between the value and the
mean.)
Chapter 9:Money Management and Recordkeeping
We can’t simply take an average (arithmetic mean) of the deviations because
they will always add up to zero — the negative deviations cancel out the posi-
tive. To overcome this difficulty, square each deviation by multiplying it by
itself. This gets rid of the minus (negative) sign, because a negative multi-
plied by a negative equals a positive.
So for Column B, we have:
Deviation
Deviation squared
-5
-2
+1
+2
+4
25

4
16
The mean of the squared deviations is called the variance:
Variance = 25 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 16 = 50 = 10
5
5
The variance is a measure with uses of its own. However, it has a big disad-
vantage for everyday use: If the original values were in dollars (as they would
be when you’re calculating your hourly winnings or losses in a poker game),
then the variance would be in dollars squared!
To get those theoretical (but hardly practical) “dollars squared” back into
regular dollars, you need to take the square root of the variance. This result
is the standard deviation.
The standard deviation of the distribution shown above equals 3.16228. (If
you multiplied 3.16228 by itself , you’d get 10.)
The same calculations for the distribution in Column A yield a variance of
399.6, and a standard deviation of 19.99.
If you don’t have a calculator handy, Table 9-1 is a handy guide of square
roots to use. (You’ll have to do a bit of estimating to come up with precise
answers for numbers that fall between those listed on the table.)

Calculations made easier
Now that you’ve walked through the process of calculating a standard devia-
tion and understand the process, here’s how to simplify the calculations. Get
a pocket calculator containing statistical functions. For less than $20, you can
eliminate these time-consuming arithmetical steps.
Better yet, if you have a personal computer, use any of the popular spread-
sheet programs to store your data. Set up properly, all you’ll have to enter
are your hourly winnings or losses. You then use the spreadsheet’s statistical
capabilities to calculate your average hourly results (the mean) and standard
deviation on a cumulative basis.
Using standard deviation to analyze your
poker results
When you begin to analyze your poker results, you’ll see that you’re really
trying to maximize your hourly winnings while minimizing your standard
deviation. In other words, you’d like to win as much as you possibly can
while subjecting your bankroll to the smallest possible fluctuations.

From a statistical viewpoint, when you live on
in earnings. If you're not comfortable at a cer-

tain level of risk, or you are playing on a short

standard deviationthan trying to maximize your
ance and how much of your bankroll you're will-

UM
ing to risk in order to gain somemarginalboosts
j
That situation, of course, is a real conundrum. If you choose to take the risks
required to maximize winnings — such as getting all those extra bets in
whenever you believe you have the best hand — you also tend to increase
bankroll fluctuations simply because you’re not going to come out on top in
every one of those marginal situations.
In fact, because they’re all very close calls, you’ll probably wind up losing a
lot of those confrontations. Let’s face it, whenever you make a full house or
some other equally monstrous hand, it’s never a close call. You’re going to
get all the money you possibly can into the pot, because you’re going to win
the vast majority of those hands.
When you’re out there on the edge, however, you’re bound to lose nearly as
many hands as you win. You’re hoping, of course, to win more often than not,
in order to maximize your winnings. But you’re bound to experience fluctua-
tions as you navigate this precarious path.
How) to Reduce Fluctuations in a
Poker Game
151
By avoiding marginal situations that require you to put additional money into
the pot when it’s a close call, you can play with a smaller bankroll. If you’re a
winning player, you’ll eventually win just as much money. It will just take
more hours at the table to reach your goals.
There is no right or wrong way to put money at risk in a poker game. Some
people are comfortable with a high level of risk and have the bankroll to
accommodate the fluctuations, which inevitably accompany this kind of play.
/52
Part II: Advanced Strategy
Others aren’t so comfortable with high risk. In fact, you’ll frequently hear
players bemoaning the fact that they are at a table full of live ones (weak
opponents who call too frequently). “I wish there were two or three good
players at the table,” they’re likely to say, “because they bring more stability
to the game and my good hands tend to hold up.”
From a statistical perspective, this comment is a cry for a smaller standard
deviation, along with an expression of those players’ willingness to accept
the slightly smaller win rate that goes along with it. Even without a knowl-
edge of statistics, these players have learned that when you operate on the
edge, the price you pay for an increased win rate is usually a significantly
larger increase in the fluctuations you can expect.
As the win rate increases marginally, the standard deviation tends to fluctuate
dramatically.
What does this mean to you as a player? Do you live on the edge, or seek
whatever safety nets might be available? As long as you can afford to play the
game you’re in, this becomes a matter of personal choice. Remember:
;
Only you can decide how much uncertainty you’re comfortable with.
^ If you elect to push every advantage, no matter how small, you can
expect significantly higher fluctuations than you’d experience if you
were willing to trade off that win rate for a bit more stability.
^ If you elect to maximize your win rate, then you’ll need a larger bankroll
to play the game.
Howl Big Should J/our Poker Bankroll Be7
How large a bankroll do you need to outlast any bad run of cards and ensure
that you’ll never go broke? This question comes up repeatedly whenever
poker players start talking.
While “How big a bankroll .. .” is a complex issue that can’t be resolved by
applying a rule or formula, there is one fact you can bank on with absolute
certainty: If you are not a winning player, your bankroll will never be large
enough. To eliminate the possibilities of ever going broke, losing players need
a big enough bankroll to outlast their life expectancy. Without one, they’ll
find themselves regularly infusing their playing stake with fresh cash.
A good rule for a reliable bankroll is 300 bets. If a bankroll of $6,000 to play
$10-$20 Hold’em seems like a shockingly high number, we recommend read-
ing Gambling Theory and other Topics by Mason Malmuth. It’s an amazingly
insightful work into some of the statistical realities that surround poker.
II
Chapter 9: Money Management and Recordkeeping
You’ll find out how the ups and downs of fate can produce some extreme
results over the short run, and even $6,000 may be a conservative estimate
for that game.
But 300 big bets is not the whole story. If you were an outstanding player in a
regular game composed of absolutely horrendous, extremely passive players
(who seldom raised but always called until all hope, no matter how small,
was completely dissipated), we’re certain you could play on a much smaller
bankroll without the risk of going broke. But few among us have been lucky
enough to find a regular game filled with players who are that bad.
Even when you’re a favorite in your game, you’re probably not a prohibitive
one. Here are some tips:
^ If your opponents are generally good players, you probably need more
than 300 big bets to hedge against going broke
But for the average working professional player — the guy who plays
every day trying to win between one and one-and-a-half big bets per
hour — the conventional wisdom of a 300 big-bet bankroll makes good
sense.
A fool and his money . . .
Some players really do have bankrolls that can outlast their life expectancy.
In Southern California, where there’s always lots of loose money at play in
card casinos, these players have the derisive nickname “trust-fund pros.”
Many play every day and will swear to you that they are long-term winners.
Trust-fund pros seldom deceive their opponents no matter how strongly they
claim to be winning players. They delude only themselves, and their oppo-
nents know it.
The price of self-deception, however, can be high. Consider a 40-year-old
trust-fund pro who plays $10-$20 and loses an average of one big bet per
hour. If he plays 2,000 hours a year and lives to be 85, he can expect to lose
$1.8 million by playing poker. Outside of a very select few, that’s a lot of
money by anyone’s measure.
Suppose this particular player is not really that bad and loses only $3 per
hour. He’ll still run through $270,000 in the course of his playing lifetime. It’s
not as bad as $1.8 million, but still a stack of jack for most folks.
The best thing you can say about this player is that he did a good job of
financial planning if he started with a $270,000 bankroll and spent his last
dollar on his last day of life. (If he did a perfect job of financial planning, he’d
work it so close to the nub that his check to the undertaker would bounce.)

Why many poker players wear hats
Players who are new to the poker scene might
be puzzled by the sightof many players wearing
hats (or sunglasses) at the poker table, for
example, Amarillo Slim Preston probably
wouldn't be recognized without his trademark
Stetson. He, and many other top players,
routinely wear hats- including baseball caps,
sun visors, and cowboy hats — while playing
poker.
The explanation usually has nothing to do with
presenting a certain image, as much as it is
a tactic geared toward fending off "tells" (tell-
tale indications).
"Iwear a big-brimmed Stetson so people won't
see my eyes," Amarillo Slim explains. "See, a
man's eyes usually give off what he’s thinking.
So,I keep my head down and my eyes hidden
soIcan keep'em guessing."
Most players supplement their playing bankroll. While there are more than a
few trust-fund pros out there, many players underwrite their poker with their
paycheck. Poker, for the majority of players, is recreation — just a hobby—
and if they lose today, it’s no big deal. They can supplement their bankroll on
payday, and as long as their losses do not exceed their discretionary income,
they don’t need to concern themselves with having an adequate bankroll.
0
A
ji
For all the players who are not lifelong winners (and estimates suggest that
85 percent to 90 percent of all players do not beat the game), an adequate
bankroll means either a trust fund big enough to sustain a lifetime of losses,
or a paycheck that can cover their losses from one payday to the next —
without risking the rent.
HoW professional players maintain
their bankrolls
How much money do you need to keep from going broke if you’re a profes-
sional and poker is your paycheck?
A professional poker player should realize that every dollar she wins will not
be added to her bankroll. After all, she has to pay rent and buy groceries just
like anyone else, and her only source of income is her winnings. Lose, and
she pays her bills the only way she can: by dipping into her bankroll. But
there’s a limit to how deeply she can dig without puttirg herself in jeopardy.
Reducing your bankroll converts capital into income — and that distinction is
an important one. Change too much capital into income and you’ve eaten
your seed corn.
Chapter 9:Money Management and Recordkeeping
When a professional poker player on a short bankroll hits a protracted losing
streak, she has only a few choices:
I v0 Get a job in order to build up her bankroll (in which case she is revers-
ing the process and converts income to capital)
I i00 Become a horse by playing on a backer’s money (But a horse takes only
a percentage of her winnings.)
|v* Quit poker entirely — or at least until she rebuilds her playing stake to a
I
sizeable amount.
None of these options is very desirable for working professional poker
players.
Bleeding off capital is not limited to poker players either. Businesses do it all
the time. When veteran airline company Pan-Am was on the rocks, it sold its
flagship building in New York City. Therefore, Pan-Am’s balance sheet made it
seem like the company had a good year. But you can convert capital into
income only once, and then it’s gone.
A poker player’s bankroll is his capital. When poker is your business, you
don’t need money to build factories, or buy office buildings, trucks, machine
tools, or computers. Money— in the form of a playing bankroll — is your
capital. Lose some of it and you’ll probably have to drop down and play at
smaller limits, put the screws to your personal spending habits, and grind out
an adequate bankroll. If you lose too much, you’ll be so undercapitalized that
you’ll be ill-equipped to even compete at all.
Moving Up to Bigger Limits
Can you still take occasional shots at bigger games? Sure— and you proba-
bly should — as long as the game looks good and you think you can win. If
anything, it will help you prepare for the next move up the poker ladder, once
your bankroll grows large enough to play there regularly.
Limit poker, after all, is like a job. As long as you’re a winning player, the more
hours you put in, the more money you’ll earn. And if you give yourself a pay
raise by jumping to a bigger game, you ought to earn more in the long run.
Just make sure you don’t take risks you can’t afford — like playing on a short
bankroll. Without a sufficient cushion, all it takes is a few big losses to find
yourself terminally downsized.
As for using money-management concepts— like setting stop-loss limits and
quitting once you’ve won some predetermined amount of money — and
thinking they will shield you against the possibilities of going broke, forget
about it.

Discussing pay-off structures
Finding information about tournaments
Wiroker tournaments provide the opportunity to invest a relatively small
9
amount of money in order to win a big payout. Tournaments have shown
a great increase in popularity, with the premier tournament events occurring
at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas.
While we can’t give you all of the secrets to winning a world championship
poker tournament ( both of us have visions of winning that some year), this
chapter does offer some of the basics of tournaments and practical tips.
To get really good at poker, and to have a shot at the World Championship,
you need to get experience. So plan to enter a number of smaller tourna-
ments before you invest $10,000 to enter the World Championship. Oh, and if
you do get there and win, don’t forget to credit us for giving you the initial
insight!(Acknowledgments and cash sent to the authors will be graciously
accepted.)
Why Play Poker Tournaments?
We can think of many reasons to play in poker tournaments, probably as
many as there are players who enter them. Poker tournaments can be excit-
ing, lucrative, and invaluable for gaining experience. What follows are rea-
sons why you should consider entering tournaments.
Part III: Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms
The thrill of Victory
First of all, tournaments are fun. There’s nothing like the thrill of competition
that gets our competitive juices flowing. Sure it’s nice to play in a cash game
and walk away a winner at the end of the day. It’s a terrific feeling to stuff the
pockets of your jeans with your winnings, and to live — even for a moment —
that famous line from Walter Tevis’s The Color of Money. “Money won,” Paul
Newman’s character Fast Eddie says as he reveals an ageless truth to Tom
Cruise, “is twice as sweet as money earned.”
Learn new games inexpensively
Aside and apart from the competition and the fun factor, tournaments are a
terrific way to learn new games. Here’s why: The game you want to learn
might not be offered at betting limits that are comfortable for you. In fact, in
smaller casinos, the game might not be available at all. Without tournaments,
how can you ever learn to play Omaha/8, or Razz, or Seven-Stud/8 in a card
casino that has enough room for only a few Hold’em and Stud tables?
If you enter low-buy-in tourneys, you can get plenty of play for a limited
amount of money. You might get to play two or three hours of Razz for a $25
buy-in. That’s not enough time to let you master the game, but it will be suffi-
cient to help you decide if you enjoy it, and whether you have a feel for the
game. (For details about buy-ins, see the section called “Buy-ins and fees” in
this chapter.)
Tournaments can be a powerful learning tool because your investment is lim-
ited to the cost of the buy-in; and without mounting losses to worry about,
you can devote your time to becoming more knowledgeable and more profi-
cient at a new game.
The game is"pure
19
Not only are your costs fixed when you enter a tournament, the game is
invariably a bit more pure and uncluttered than cash games. More of your
opponents are prone to play by the book in tournaments because they realize
that once they lose their buy-in, it’s finis — at least as far as that event is con-
cerned. Tournament players follow the rules closely, so it’s a bit easier for
new players to see how theory works in practice. In a cash game, by compari-
son, the proper way to do things frequently get skewed by someone with an
unlimited bankroll and a hankerin’ to gamble.
Chapter 10: Poker Tournaments

I
Take on the champs
Finally, tournaments are a way to match your skills with some of the best play-
ers in the world. You’re probably not going to see world-class players— the
kind you’ve read about in Card Player or Poker Digest magazines— entering a
$25 buy-in tournament in a small riverboat casino in Middle America, but you
certainly will find players of this ilk entered in $100 buy-in tournaments in Las
Vegas, Atlantic City, Connecticut, Mississippi, and California.
Nothing does as much for the confidence of a beginner than sitting at the
same table with a big-name opponent and finding out that that player also
faces the same challenges that you do.
J
Hey, you might even get lucky, catch a card and knock one of these big names
out of the event. Then you can point to his picture in one of the magazines
and say to all your friends, “He wasn’t so tough. Why, I eliminated him when
my set filled up on the river and just destroyed that pathetic flush of his!”
Poker Tournament Basics
Tournaments come in all types and sizes. They can consist of Hold’em, Seven-
Card Stud, Lowball, Omaha, or other games. Here, we give you the basics
regarding cost, betting structures, and the prize pool.
Buy-ins and fees
To participate in a tournament, you need to pay an entry fee called a buy-in. The
entry fee buys you a seat in the tournament, where each player receives the
same number of chips to begin with. The fee can range from a small amount
($100 is common) to a large amount ($10,000 for the World Championship).
Some tournaments are structured so that once you have lost the chips in
front of you, you are out of the tournament. Others are rebuy tournaments,
where you can buy more chips (after your initial buy-in) during a designated
period of time — usually during the first hour or two of play, or during the
first few betting limits.
Bettiny structures
In typical tournaments, the betting structure starts out with limits of $15-$30
or $25-$50. Betting limits then increase regularly, either every 30 minutes, 45
minutes, or hourly. The betting increase is often double the bet from the
prior round.
Part III: Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms
In flop games, like Texas Hold’em and Omaha, two players also have to put
up a certain amount of money before the cards are dealt. (These bets are
usually called a small blind and a big blind?) The blinds are usually put up by
the two people to the left of where the dealer button is placed (the button, of
course, moves counterclockwise each hand). And the sizes of those blinds go
up each time the betting rounds go up. So even if you never play a hand, the
blinds eventually destroy your chip stock.
In some tournaments, no-limit or pot-limit rules apply:
i* No-limit tournaments: In these tournaments, players can bet any
amount of money in front of them.
v0 Pot-limit tournaments: Here, a bettor is allowed to bet an amount equal
to the pot.
The prize pool
The prize pool in tournaments depends on the size of the entry fee and the
number of players. The larger the overall pool of money available for split-
ting, the more opportunities will exist for finishing “in the money.”
For example, if you have a tournament with a $500 buy-in and you get 400
entrants, you might have the top 18 finishers winning money. Table 10-1
shows a representative split for such a tournament (although the exact split
varies from tournament to tournament).

So, if you are lucky enough to take first place, you can walk away with a cool
$80,000!
That big prize is why tournaments have become so popular; there’s the
potential of a big bang for a small buck. Think of it this way: If you were a suc-
cessful $20-$40 player — one who wins an average of one big bet per hour —
that $80,000 first-place prize represents 2,000 hours of play in a cash game.
Yes, you really can win an entire year’s worth of money in one day!
But it’s not all glamour and glory, either. Even top-notch tournament players
can go a long time— years, even — without winning. Because tournament
pay structures are so top-heavy (unless you are good enough to come in
either first, second, or third periodically), the entry fees can deplete your
bankroll sooner than you might expect.
For the very best tournament professionals, who seldom play cash games but
travel the world from one major tournament to another, they have the added
expense of sustaining themselves on the road. While travel may be broaden-
ing and playing poker for big bucks may seem glamorous, airfares, hotel bills,
and the relatively high cost of eating all your meals out quickly mount up.
Satellite tournaments
Satellites are essentially mini-tournaments. A satellite is usually a tournament
composed of one table, and the victor typically wins a seat in the main tour-
nament. Super-satellites are multitable events where several seats are
awarded for the main tournament. Satellites are a good way to get the feel of
a game without committing as much money as would be required for the
main tournament.
So check out playing in a satellite before jumping into the main tournament.

The Relationship Between Blinds and
Betting Structure
One of the key differences between tournament poker and cash games is the
relationship between the blinds and the betting structure. This difference is
so significant, that many of the strategies that are employed in tournaments
are directly derived from this difference.
BE*
A
Take a look at cash games first. If you were going to play $20-$40 Hold’em,
you’d probably buy in to the game with approximately $800 in chips. That’s
common. Some players will enter the game with $500 and others with $1,000,
but $800 seems to be typical. That $800 is the equivalent of 20 big bets and
provides the opportunity to play quite a few hands before having to reach
into your pockets for an additional buy-in.
In cash games, the blinds and betting structure remain fixed, and you can buy
more chips anytime you’re not involved in a hand.
Chapter 10:Poker Tournaments
The escalating blinds
In tournament poker, you can’t buy more chips at any old time. Unless it’s
during a tournament’s rebuy period, once your chips are gone, so are you. If
that’s not enough, the blinds (or antes, as the case may be) escalate at fixed
intervals.
If the blinds and antes did not escalate at fixed intervals, tournaments would
take days to complete. After all, most players would wait for outstanding
hands before entering a pot. And what fun would that be? It would make
poker the equivalent of watching paint dry, and nobody wants that.
Because blinds and antes escalate, one is forced to play. When a player’s
chips have been depleted, and she will be facing the blind in a hand or two, it
may be the best course of action for her to go all in with as little as ace-any-
thing (an ace plus whatever else is in the hand). After all, if she doesn’t, she’ll
have to risk going all-in with the random cards she’ll receive in the blind.
In the early stages of a poker tournament, the structure is similar to a cash
game. Suppose 200 players buy into a tournament and each receives $500 in
chips. The betting limits during the first round might be $15-$30. Under
these conditions, if a player flops a four flush (four cards of the same suit), he
can afford to take the chance and draw for it.
In the later stages of a tourney, however, taking such a chance often isn’t
worth the risk. Suppose you are one of the last eight remaining players. Since
200 players bought in initially, there was $100,000 in tournament chips in
play. If you divide that equally among the remaining eight players, the par
value is $12,500. In other words, if a player has precisely $12,500 at this stage
of the tournament, he is average by definition.
The end game
So let’s say you are one of the last remaining participants of the orginal 200
entrants in a tournament. By then, the blinds might have escalated to
$l,000-$2,000. Even though our hero might have precisely $15,500 in chips,
he has only 6X big bets left — a far cry from the 16& big bets he had when he
began the tourney with $500 in chips at the $15-$30 betting limits.
Now flush and straight draws become dicey propositions. In most cases you
don’t want to risk elimination on a speculative hand. If you are to be elimi-
nated, you want to have something that stands a chance of holding up. Even a
mediocre pair can do in a pinch. A flush draw or a straight draw that does not
hold up will not win very many pots.

If you are very short-stacked (that is, you don’t have a lot of chips left), the
Hobson’s choice that you’re confronted with is either to go all-in of your own
volition with a hand like A-4 of different suits, or be forced to go all-in on the
blind — when all you will be holding are random cards.
Be extremely selective; be Very ayyressiVe
Two opposing forces are at work here in late stages of tournaments, and they
are both caused by the changing nature of the relationship between the inex-
orably escalating blinds and the betting structure: One force is a push that
says, “Be aggressive! You have to take a stand because you don’t have very
many chips left.” The countervailing measure is pulling at you, saying “Be
selective. You can’t afford to be eliminated without a good hand.”
The eternal problem, of course, is that you seldom know with any certainty
whether to wait for a better hand, or make your stand with the cards you’ve
been dealt. Therein lies the art of tournament poker. But it’s the continuing
escalation of the blinds and their relationship to the betting limits that makes
tournament poker what it is.
Key Mistakes Made in Poker
Tournaments
Players make numerous mistakes in poker tournaments. The action can be
fast and you may encounter new situations and difficult decisions. This sec-
tion highlights some common mistakes.
Chapter10: Poker Tournaments 167
'
Trying to vUin too early
Some players gamble aggressively early on, hoping to get a major chip advan-
tage, and then keep playing aggressively to win it all early. But gambling too
much, rather than changing gears and slowing down, can often cause you to
crash and burn.
Defending your blind too much
Many players try to defend their blinds too much. If you have just a mediocre
hand, consider folding it instead of matching the bet and getting tied to a
seemingly cheap hand.
Playing too tight
While you generally shouldn’t be super aggressive in late stages, it’s also a
mistake to play overly conservative just to hang on for a final table finish.
Playing too tight can unnecessarily erode your stack of chips because in the
later stages of a tournament, the blind structure is usually very high in rela-
tion to the number of chips in play. And if you play too tight in the early
stages so that you survive, you probably won’t end up with enough chips in
later hands to be a serious contender.
Playing a marginal hand after the flop
Don’t feel that you have to play a marginal hand after the flop. Even if in
Hold’em you flop a pair, but your kicker card is weak, consider laying it down
if a solid player bets into you.
Being unaware of other players’
chip stacks
As you get near the end of a tournament, it’s a huge mistake if you are not
carefully paying attention to the stacks of chips that other players hold.
Knowing their chip position can help you make key decisions, such as
whether or not to even play a hand.
168
Part III: Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms
For example, assume there are only eight players remaining and you have a
medium number of chips, and two players have very low stacks of chips. At
this point, you may very well want to play very conservatively and let those
two players get knocked out ahead of you. Remember, each player who is
eliminated promotes you one rung higher on the pay ladder. Don’t forget,
however, that the big payoff is for first place, so be willing to take reasonable
shots.
Tournament Tips from a World Champion
Tom McEvoy, the 1983 World Champion of Poker, has numerous tips for
playing winning tournament poker. Here are 10 tips from Tom’s great book,
Tournament Poker.
^ You need to adjust your play throughout the tournament. There is
more than one winning style of tournament play. You need to keep in
mind the stage of the tournament and your stack of chips. For example,
while you may play loose early on and accumulate a lot of chips, you
should consider slowing down later on to preserve your chip lead and
let other players get knocked out.
Always be aware of the chip counts of your opponents. Particularly in
later stages, you want to know where you stand relative to the other
players. You may want to push someone with a short stack all-in, or you
may want to let other players knock each other out for a while.
v0 You need to play the player and his stack. Even with a big stack, you
must still use judgment and choose your spots. Be aware of which play-
ers have loosened up and those who have tightened up to survive to the
final table. Short stacks will sometimes raise with less than premium
hands, so you can comfortably call them if you have a big stack.
Never leave a short stack with only one or two remaining chips when
you can put him all-in. In the later stages of a tournament, a few chips
can multiply quickly because of the high limits, so don’t be nice and not
put a player all-in when you have the opportunity to do so cheaply. Be
cruel!
i/ You must make correct decisions in the blinds. Correct decisions on
your blind hands can often spell the difference between success and fail-
ure in a tournament. Playing the blind correctly requires extreme pru-
dence and discretion.
Take advantage of tight play. When everyone else is playing tight in the
later stages of a tournament you can take more chances and be more
aggressive.
Chapter 10:Poker Tournaments 169
Bluffing is an important weapon in No-Limit Hold’em. Bluffing can be
very powerful in No-Limit Hold’em. The larger your stack, the more
intimidating your bluff.
Study your opponents. You must study your opponents especially when
you are not actively involved in the hand. You want to get a sense of how
loose or tight they are and how they play, for future reference.
v* Learn to survive. Learning how to survive long enough to give yourself
a chance to get lucky is essential. Anyone who has won a tournament
has gotten lucky during various stages of that event. But in order to max-
imize your opportunity to get lucky, you must hone your survival skills.
v* Stay calm, cool, and collected. You are going to get some bad beats in a
tournament. You must maintain a tough mental attitude and not go on
tilt. Many players lose a few hands, and then both their discipline and
their stacks begin to crumble. Don’t be that type of person, and do take
advantage of that type of player.

Cutting a Deal at the Final Table
Often, the survivors at the final table of a poker tournament cut deals. For
example, if there are only four players left and the payouts are first place, 40
percent; second place, 20 percent; third place, 10 percent; fourth place, 5 per-
cent; and the remaining places, 25 percent, then the last four players could
agree to a different cut no matter how the tournament officially ends.
Deals are usually made when there are huge differences between the prize
money and when the chips are all reasonably close.
Should you cut a deal? Well^you need to assess the following:
|\S The quality of the remaining players
|^ The relative chip counts
!** Your experience level in tournaments versus the experience levels of
other players
I
The type of deal offered
Making a deal can make a lot of sense, guaranteeing you a good win. But it
does limit your upside. How much of a gambler are you?
The fairest utay to cut a deal
When there are just two of you left, you can easily cut a deal that’s fair for
both parties— regardless of how many chips each player may have. Take a
look at the prize pool structure in Table 10-1, where the winner walks away
with $80,000 and second place wins $40,000.
Just suppose you’re in that situation. From a starting field of 400 entrants
there are only two of you left. After hours and hours of play, you’ve come this
far. Regardless of whether you win it or finish second, you can count on a
nice payday.
But wait, there’s a big, big difference between the first-place prize of $80,000 and
the second-place payout of $40,000. And unless you have an insurmountable
chip lead, things can change very rapidly in the end game of a tournament.
The blinds are likely to be extremely high in relation to your chip count —
yes, even if you’re leading— and because of it, you are forced to take
chances. When you’re playing for very large sums of money, and your skill
has thus far enabled you to best all but one of your opponents, the last thing
you’ll probably want to do is gamble.
Chapter 10:Poker Tournaments
171
Here’s the easiest way to cut a deal that’s fair to both players. Remember that
you are each guaranteed a payoff of $40,000, since with just two players
remaining, neither of you can finish worse than second.
There’s $120,000 in prize money at stake, and each of you has locked up
$40,000. You’re now playing for the difference between first and second place,
which is also $40,000. Let’s assume you have 55 percent of the chips in play,
and your opponent has the remaining 45 percent. To be fair, all you have to
do is prorate the $40,000 that’s being contested by the relative chip counts:
55 percent of $40,000 is $22,000. Add that to the $40,000 you have already
locked up, and the chip leader should receive $62,000.
The person in second place, who holds 45 percent of the chips in play, should'
receive $18,000. When added to his $40,000 in lock-up money, it amounts to a
$58,000 payday.
When the chip count is identical
When the chip count is identical or nearly identical, players often agree to
take an even share of the money after cutting out a small portion to play for.
If you and your opponent each had the same number of chips, you might
agree to lock up $55,000 each, and play it out for the remaining $10,000. This
way each player hedges his bets and is ensured of a $55,000 payday. The
winner, of course, will receive $65,000.
No, it’s not quite as attractive as an $80,000 payday, but it’s a whole lot better
than taking home $40,000 because lady luck gazed unfavorably on you that day.
When more than two players make a deal, the mathematics becomes quite
complicated. When this happens, deals are usually struck by negotiation
rather than computed arithmetically.
Issues With Payoff Structures
There’s always been a lot of discussion in the poker community about the rel-
atively top-heavy nature of tournament pay structures. Ask a tournament
poker player which she prefers, and she’ll invariably say something like,
‘Let’s keep it like it is, and reward the winner.”
i
i
Part III: Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms
The ethics of deal making
Some in the poker community are concerned about the perception of impro-
priety that surrounds deal making. After all, you don’t see PGA golfers making
deals prior to the final round on Sunday, do you? Others in the poker commu-
nity are of the “So what; it’s our money, isn’t it” school of thought. And
they’re right. Poker tournaments don’t have sponsors like the PGA tour.
Poker players do put their own money at risk, and what’s wrong with hedging
a risky proposition anyway?
Still others say that poker will never attract corporate sponsorship unless
they eliminate deal making at the final table, because even the mere percep-
tion of impropriety will seqd sponsors fleeing like a herd of stampeding cattle.
Expanded payoff structures
Professional poker player Mike Sexton, who founded the Poker Tournament
of Champions, is a man who would love to see corporate sponsorship of tour-
nament poker. He decided to attack the questions of deal making and top-
heavy payout structure head-on.
Entrants in the 1999 Tournament of Champions were asked to vote on
whether they would prefer to see the traditional payout format — the one we
used for an illustration earlier in this chapter — or an expanded payout
structure put in place. The expanded structure would award 35 percent to
the first-place finisher instead of 40 percent. The second- and third-place fin-
ishers would also receive slightly less, but in return, the payoff would be
extended and more players would be paid.
When the votes were tallied, the expanded payoff structure was the over-
whelming choice, by a nearly 65 percent-35 percent result. Maybe the fact
that deal making is forbidden at the Tournament of Champions is what led the
majority of entrants to hedge their bets by weighing-in on the side of an
expanded pay structure. Perhaps it’s just a signal of changing times in the
poker community. Or maybe the majority of players have all come to realize
that corporate sponsorship— and there’s not a player out there who wouldn’t
want to be playing for someone else’s money rather than his or her own —
won’t come about until the winner is decided by competition rather than
negotiation.

y now you have digested most of this book, and you’ve vastly increased

your skills at the poker table. Now you’re ready to apply all of that
newly gained poker knowledge to video poker. Right?
Sorry! The first thing you need to understand about video poker is that it is
not poker. Although some similarities exist between the on-screen game and
the traditional cards-in-hand version, important differences make video poker
attractive to anyone who doesn’t want to work so hard to gain an edge.
But everyone occasionally loses a big pot that he or she expected to win and
needs a diversion to regain composure. Why not a profitable diversion? Also,
many poker players are accompanied by their spouse or a friend who blows
their money on the slots while waiting. Why not make their time profitable (or
at least cut the expected losses to a minimum)? For many people, video
poker fits the bill perfectly, and it may even become your next gambling love.
This chapter shows how anyone can become a winner at video poker. What’s
that? You say you hit a royal flush just last month? Of course, and almost
everyone hits an exhilarating jackpot occasionally, but over time most have a
net loss. (So how did you think the casinos pay for the bright lights?) With
just a little effort, however, you can be a winner. By seeking out the good
machines (defined later in this chapter) and following a few simple playing
rules, you can greatly reduce your expected loss rate, and in some cases, you
can gain a real edge over the casino and have an expected win rate instead.

The Basics of Video Poker
Video poker shares some of the characteristics of a slot machine. The gam-
bling gear itself is housed in a similar cabinet, and most have a coin slot and
a payout hopper. Many have a slot-club card reader and/or a bill acceptor.
The important difference is that on a reel slot you just pull the handle and
hope for the best, but video poker involves an element of skill.
To the novice player, the main attraction of video poker is the prospect of pit-
ting wits against the machine in fast action with a chance at a big jackpot. To
the skilled player, however, the appeal is that some games offer an opportu-
nity for a long-term profit. Just as in a live poker game, you can expect a con-
siderable amount of risk and luck involved in the short term, but a player’s
skill can make the difference between a winner and a loser in the long run.
Unlike the no-brainer reel slots, the maximum payback of any video poker
game can be ascertained from the game’s payoff schedule. No, you don’t have
to do any math; just compare the payoff schedule shown on the glass or the
screen of every machine with the tables below. A game’s rated payback — the
statistically projected return on money played — generally assumes perfect
play. But leave perfection to the pros; we won’t even attempt it here, yet we
will easily get very close to the rated payback for a much higher return than
is possible on any other low stakes casino game. The rated payback of each
game is discussed in the individual sections that follow in this chapter.
Getting started
First, find an attractive game by comparing its payoff schedule with Tables
11-1 and 11-2. Then, insert your player’s card. The slot-club rebate may make
up a significant portion of your expected win rate, or it may even turn a nega-
tive expectation game into a positive situation. If the casino has a slot club
and you don’t have a card, you should get one before you begin playing.
Nearly every casino has a slot club, and membership is free. Before playing,
go to the slot-club booth, fill out an application, and get your card. You may
want to ask for two cards so you have a spare in case you leave one behind,
or if you want to play two machines at once. In some casinos, your friend or
spouse would be on the same account, and in others each of you would have
a separate account.
Slot clubs have a variety of inventive names, but they all serve the same pur-
pose of enticing you to play more at that casino by offering comps (compen-
sation) and/or cash rebates for your play. Check out the club brochure for
information on what you can get for your loyalty to that casino.
Chapter 11: Video Poker 177
Playing hands
Now you’re ready to play. To begin a hand, insert the number of coins you
want to play. Although most machines accept from one to five coins, some
accept only three or four, some accept eight or ten, and a few accept up to
100 coins. Always play at least the number of coins required to qualify for the
full per-coin payoff on all jackpots (five coins on most machines).
After inserting the coins or pressing the Max Bet button, the machine “deals”
your first five cards. Most machines immediately tell you if you have a dealt
paying hand by beeping and displaying the type of hand. Select the cards that
you want to keep by pressing the Hold buttons. There is one Hold button for
each card on the screen. On most machines, you can press the same Hold (or
Hold/Cancel) button again to deselect a card. The word HELD appears on the
screen above, below, or across the center of each card selected.
Some of the newer machines have touch-sensitive screens, enabling you to
select which cards to hold simply by touching their images on the screen.
You can also touch the screen for the Bet and Deal functions, but most seri-
ous players speed up the process by using the buttons for all functions.
You can sometimes break up a paying hand that’s been dealt. For example,
you may choose to break a dealt flush or straight in favor of a four-card royal
flush draw — most of the strategy depends upon the actual game.
When you’re satisfied with your selection, press the Deal/Draw button to
replace the discards in an attempt to make a winning hand (or to improve an
existing winner), just as you would do in a live draw poker game. The game is
then over. If you end up with a winning hand, the machine automatically pays
according to the payoff schedule.
ftHf
u|
Most modern machines provide for credit play. That is, your wins step up a
credit counter on the screen instead of automatically dropping coins, and
you may bet from those credits rather than insert coins for your next play. If
you are playing at over 100 percent expected payback, your average win rate
is in direct proportion to your playing speed. So, always use credit play for
maximum speed. Some machines feature Max Bet buttons for playing the
maximum number of coins, or Replay or Deal buttons for requesting the same
number of coins as for the preceding play. In either case, the deal for your
next hand begins when you press one of the buttons.

Video Poker Versus Regular Poker
Video poker uses the same 52-card deck (or 53 cards with the joker) as table
poker, and most video poker games deal the cards pretty much like the
(almost extinct) table game of five-card draw. Also, the hand ranks and the
card combinations that make up those hands are generally the same, but the
similarity ends there.
So just how is video poker different? Consider the following:

other players are involved.

In live poker, the distinction between a straight flush and a royal flush is
slim. Except for rare cases in Hold’em, either flush is almost certain to
win the entire pot every time, but a royal flush in video poker pays at
least 16 times as much as a straight flush.
I
In live poker, aces up (two pair) is a much stronger hand than 7s up; in
1
video poker all two pair hands pay the same.

In live poker, any four-of-a-kind always beats a lower four-of-a-kind. In

some video poker games, four 2s, 3s or 4s pays more than four 5s through

Video poker myths
There aremanymyths surrounding all gambling
games,and video poker is no exception.Here
are some of the most common myths about
video poker,and the truth behind each myth.
Myth:Look for a machinethathasn'thitrecently.
It's probably due for a jackpot
Fact You may have heard that a royal flush
occurs about once per 40,000 plays, but that
doesn't mean that a machine can be “due" to
hit No matter now recently or how long since a
machine haspaid a jackpot the randomnumber
generator used to shuffle the cards has no
can run "hot" or "cold" for short periods but
there is no way of knowingahead of time when
any such streak will begin or end.
Myth;The machines are set for a specific pay-
back,so the way you play doesn't matter.
Fact This is only a lazy player's excuse for not
learning how to be a winner. You may as well
say it doesn't matter how you play live table
poker since the cards are shuffled,thus giving
everyone an equal chance at a good hand.Skill
is a big factor atvideo poker,just asinlivetable
poker, and the good games can exist only
because themajority of players give up about 2
percent ofthe potentialpaybackby notlearning
an accurate strategy.As Mark Twain said:"Let
us bethankfulfor the fools.Butfor them,the rest
of us could not succeed."
Myth:Because the machines are random,you
can't possibly beat the games.
Fact "Random" and "beatable" are not syn-
onymous.For example,suppose youwerebank-
ing a craps game with honest dice. The
outcome of each event would be random,but
the house edgewould assurethatyou wouldbe
a winner in the long run. Some video poker
games give youthe same opportunity to bet on
the winning side of the game.
Myth:Okay,so the machines are random,but
what if they were biased so that high cards or
wild cards come up a bit less often than
expected?
Fact:You may find that sort of stacking in for-
eign casinos, on cruise ships, and so on,but
Nevada and Louisiana regulations mandate that
each unseen card in video poker must have an
equal probability of appearing just as if the
cards were being dealt from a well-shuffled,
real deck.This makesit possible to work out an
optimum playing strategy and to determine the
expectedpayback usingthat strategy.For some
games, that
expected minimum payback
exceeds 100 percent, so the game is beatable.
Because most manufacturers want to be certi-
fied in Nevada, all of their machines shipped
anywhere almost certainlymeet these require-
ments.
Myth:If youwant to bet only 25e total,play five
coins on a nickelmachine rather than one coin
on a quarter machine.
FactThatis goodadviceifthe5e and 25e games
havethesamepayoff schedule.Often,however,
you're
confronted
with
full-pay
quarter
machines but only short-pay nickel games.You
give up about 1.S percent of the long-term pay-
back by playing only one coin (since you don't
qualify forthe big royal jackpot),but a short-pay
schedule is usually even more costly. If you're
going to play anyway, it’s better to play one
quarter on a full-pay machine than five nickels
on a short-pay machine. In any case, video

These characteristics primarily make video poker a big winner for the casino,
even on games that offer over 100 percent payback. The following sections
show just how easy it is to keep the house edge to a minimum. You may even
gain an advantage over the house with the prospects of being a long-term
winner.
Jacks-or-Better Video Poker
The first step in winning takes place before you even start to play. Only a
small percentage of the wide variety of games can be beaten in the long run,
so you must first figure out /how to recognize those games. Differentiating
between full-pay and short-pay games is extremely important. Table 11-1
shows the five-coin payoff schedule for full-pay Jacks-or-Better Draw poker.

We note only the five-coin payoffs because you don’t qualify for the full 4,000-
coin (800-for-l odds) payoff for a royal flush with fewer than five coins, thus
cutting the long-term payback by up to 1.5 percent. You typically get only
250-for-l odds ($62.50 for a royal for one quarter, compared to $1,000 for five
quarters).
This machine is commonly called a 9/6 machine because of the 9-for-l payoff
for a full house and 6-for-l for a flush. The most common type of short-pay
game is an 8-to-5 payoff schedule. That is, the payoff for a full house is
reduced to 8-for-l and the payoff for a flush is reduced to 5-for-l , thus cutting
the game’s payback to only 97.3 percent. Some casinos are more subtle, cut-
ting the payoff elsewhere, so check the whole payoff schedule before starting
Chapter 11: Video Poker
to play. This game offers 99.5 percent or higher payback and is currently avail-
able in many gambling areas in 5*, 25*, 50*, $1 and higher denominations.
Knowing how to play Jacks-or-Better accurately is just as important as find-
ing a full-pay machine. The good news: the game is much easier than live
poker to play skillfully.
Here are a few rules to live by when playing Jacks-or-Better:
i
IP
%
S
Rule #1: Never break any made pay of two pair or better, with one
exception. Break anything but a pat straight flush for any four-card
royal.
Rule #2: Break a high pair only for a four-card royal or any four-card
straight flush.
v0 Rule #3: Break a low pair only for K-Q-J-10, any three-card royal, or any
four-card flush or straight flush.
Rule #4: Break a four-card flush or straight draw for any three-card royal.
v0 Rule #5: If you have both a four flush and a four straight, go for the flush.
i* Rule #6:Break A-K-Q-J only for three suited high cards.
v0 Rule #7: Break any three of A, K, Q and J for any two suited high cards.
v0 Rule #8: Hold all high cards ( jacks through aces), but discard the ace
from A-K-Q, A-K-J, or A-Q-J.
Always follow the first rule that applies to the cards dealt. For example, if you
are dealt Q*J*10*Q*8* (in any order), you have a high pair (queens),which
is a made payoff. You also have a three-card royal and a four-card inside
straight flush draw. Rule #2 says to break a high pair for any four-card
straight flush. Rule #4 says to break a four-card flush or straight for a three-
card royal, but it doesn’t say anything about breaking a four-card straight
flush, so the best play is to hold everything except the Q*. If the other four
cards are not all suited, hold the pair of queens. (Daddy told you never to
draw to an inside straight, didn’t he?) If the8* were any lower club, you
would have only a four-card flush rather than a straight flush draw; this
would make the three-card royal better than the flush draw (Rule #4), but
still not as good as the pair of queens (Rule #2).
Just how does 99.5 percent payback affect this situation? Subtracting from
100 percent, we see that we can expect to lose 0.5 percent of our bets. If you
are playing a five-coin quarter machine at 500 hands per hour (a fairly typical
rate), you are wagering $1.25 X 500 = $625 per hour. In casino lingo, this is
your “action.” On average, you can expect to lose one-half of one percent of
that, or $625 X 0.005 = $3,125 per hour. But, of course, it’s impossible to lose
fractional cents, or anything other than a multiple of $1.25 for that matter. In
the short run, your actual results will fluctuate widely above and below that
figure, but if you play long enough you can expect an average loss rate of a
little over $3 per hour.

Part III:Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms
Although we simplified the strategy a bit for this book, the strategy rules will
yield close to 99.5 percent payback on a game with the payoff schedule shown
in Table 11-1, thus cutting a hunch player’s loss rate by as much as 80 percent.
A good slot-club rebate or comps can turn this into a net winning situation.
Even with such simple rules, your expected payback is very close to the theo-
retical maximum, and much better than most other games in the casino.

deucesWild: The Best Game for
Beginners
Deuces Wild is the most widely available game that offers significantly over
100 percent long-term payback, giving you the opportunity to actually make a
long-term profit when playing video poker. As a bonus, the game features the
four 2s mini-jackpot that can be expected about once per ten hours of play.
Table 11-2 provides the five-coin payoff schedule for full-pay Deuces Wild.

Many people avoid Deuces Wild because there’s no payoff for a high pair or
even for two pair. Don’t let this scare you away. With four wild cards, three-of-
a-kind occurs more often than a high pair in Jacks-or-Better or other games
Chapter 11: Video Poker
with no wild cards. The number of final hands with no payoff is almost
exactly the same (roughly 54 percent) in both games.
Note the 25-for-5 payoff for four-of-a-kind (quads), which is very important
because fully one-third of the total payback of this game comes from quads.
Cutting the quads payoff only one unit (to 20-for-5) cuts the payback by 6 per-
cent; with rare exceptions, increases elsewhere in the schedule never make
up for this shortfall.
Many players find Deuces Wild easy to learn because the strategy is broken
down according to the number of 2s in the dealt hand. Table 11-3 offers
strategies for winning in Deuces Wild.

card straight; any three-card straight flush (including all inside
draws); Q-J, Q-10, or J-10 suited; any four-card inside straight
(except A-3-4-5)
With Table 11-3 in mind, remember these suggestions:
^ Never discard a deuce. This includes holding a one-deuce wild royal
flush rather than drawing one card for the natural royal flush. The 2s
are included in the hand names. For example, 2wKV10V is a three-card
royal flush. “2w” means “any deuce” because the suit of a wild card is
immaterial.
Always hold the card combination according to the first rule that applies
to the dealt cards. If you don’t have any of the combinations described
in Table 11-3, then you must redraw all five cards.
183
/ SI)
^art l,,: Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms

For example, if you are dealt 2wQ*6*2w7*, look under the two-deuce
I
rules. You have a made flush, but that’s not even listed since it would be
|
a waste of the two deuces! The best play is to hold everything except the
I
queen, giving you a fully open-ended straight flush draw. If the 7 had
been an 8 (leaving a gap between the 8 and 6), if the 6 and 7 weren’t
suited, or if it were 5-6 or lower instead of 6-7 or higher, then you should
I
hold only the deuces.
I v* Many people get confused about inside straight flush draws with a wild
;
card. A hand such as 2w7*8*10* is an inside draw even though you
I
could consider the 2 to be the 9*. Only six cards will complete the
I
straight flush, whereas with a fully open-ended draw— such as
|
2w7*8*9*— seven cards (5*, 6*, 10*, or J*, or any of the three
||
remaining 2s) will complete the straight flush. Note that any straight or
1
straight flush draw whose highest card is less than 7 is effectively an
inside draw.
1
Pay close attention to that very last rule in Table 11-3. (Well, I didn’t say
I
that Daddy was always right.) This is just one example of the necessity
for a different strategy for each game. In this game, eight cards can com-
plete an inside straight, making it just a little better than a five-card
I
redraw You’re facing a losing proposition either way, but it’s kind of like
I
hitting a hard 16 against a dealer’s ace in Blackjack; you’ve been dealt a
|
bad hand, and you have to play it out the best way you can. In the long
run, you stand to lose less by drawing to the inside straight than by
1
drawing five cards.

Tips for Becoming a Better Video
Poker Player
Here are some general pieces of advice that you should take to heart when
playing video poker:
|u0 Play intelligently: Learn to recognize and play only the better games,
I
and learn an accurate strategy for each game you play To do otherwise
I
is just donating your money to the casino.
I u0 Look for competitive casinos: Nevada regulations set the minimum pay-
1
back for slot machines at 75 percent, but statewide statistics show aver-
I
age paybacks in the 90 percent to 98 percent range.
I
Most casinos understand that players come back to lose more when
|
their money lasts longer Most casinos advertise that their machines are
I
“loose,” but that’s just hype.(In most cases, dropping one “o” from
1
“loose” makes a more realistic statement.) You can compare the payoff
schedules of video poker games yourself. Do it!
I u0 Consider maximum payback: No upper limits exist on game paybacks
|
in Nevada, but many newer gaming jurisdictions set a maximum payback
I
at less than 100 percent. The reason usually given is to prevent “skim-
ming” (extraction of casino winnings by feeding them to a crony), but in
%
any case, it’s to assure that the state will get its tax revenue. Save your
I
money for a trip to Las Vegas.
I v0 Go where the good games are: It doesn’t do much good to learn the
*
strategy if you can’t find any good games. Several Web sites are available
I
to keep you up-to-date on good video poker all over the country. You can
i
find links to several such sites from www . vegasplayer. com /
%
v i d e o- p o k e r . html .
I v0 Find out when the good games are available: Because machines are
I
limited, you may have trouble getting on the most attractive games in
|
the evening or on weekends. Try weekdays and early morning hours.
1 v0 Join the slot clubs: In many cases, the comps and/or cash rebate from
5
the slot club make a situation attractive. Besides the benefits shown in
the club literature, most casinos send out special offers in the mail,
t
often worth more than the slot club itself. Join the club and play at least
I
one roll of quarters in every casino you visit.

Six Mistakes to Avoid in Video Poker
Steer clear of the following goofs:
H\NG/
&
Playing an unknown or short-pay game: Most players pay little atten-
tion to the payoff schedule. We often see someone playing a short-pay
game while a full-pay machine sits idle nearby. Avoid any game that does
not match the payoff schedule shown with a published strategy.
Holding too many cards: The most common playing error is holding a
useless card (a kicker).In live draw poker, you can occasionally hold a
kicker. For example, holding an ace along with a pair gives the possibility
of making aces up, whicl] is a pretty good hand in draw poker, and it has
the deceptive value of making some opponents think you have trips. In
video poker, two pair pays the same regardless of the ranks, and decep-
tion is futile. Holding that kicker merely reduces your chances of making
three-of-a-kind or four-of-a-kind. Just remember that every card held
means one less chance of catching a desirable card. Some people just
refuse to draw five new cards, yet a significant part of your payback
comes from those five card redraws.
Playing with money you can’t afford to lose: This is a symptom of com-
pulsive behavior, and the dangers apply to all forms of gambling. If
losing that next bet means that you won’t be able to pay the rent, then
you are doomed to lose. All intelligent gamblers take risk of ruin into
account. Each bet should be only a very small percentage of your
gaming bankroll. If you don’t have some discretionary funds that are not
needed for necessities, then you shouldn’t be gambling at all.
Playing hunches: Many players think that they see patterns in the
cards, but human nature may coax us in the direction of seeing order in
chaos, much as we see faces in the clouds. The machines are random,
and hunches cost you money by leading you to deviate from the correct
strategy.
P* Following “lips” instead of a real strategy: Many general gambling
books and other publications offer brief guidelines written by someone
who may be an expert at other forms of gambling, but not video poker.
Most of these sources contain some serious errors and misconceptions.
Use a real strategy from an acknowledged authority on the subject.
P* Not optimizing your play: Your expected gain obviously will be reduced
by using too simplified a strategy (or foregoing a strategy altogether).
What many serious players don’t understand is that it may also be
reduced by attempting to use a strategy that is too highly detailed. If a
strategy is too complex for you to memorize, it slows your play and leads
to unintentional deviations. Optimum play means using an accuratestrat-
egy that is simplified just enough for fast action without deviations, but
without significant loss of expected payback. The best goal is to maximize
your expected hourly win rate without overplaying your bankroll.

:*
• Getting a glimpse at World Series highlights
•^ach year, from late April through mid-May, the world’s best poker players
mmconverge on Binion’s Horseshoe in downtown Las Vegas (also known as
“Glitter Gulch”) to compete in the World Series of Poker. (For a closer look at
Binion’s Horseshoe Casino, see the sidebar “Real gaming at Glitter Gulch.”)
The World Series of Poker comprises more than 20 separate events — each
costing between $1,500 and $10,000, and anyone with the buy-in is welcome
to enter. The play generally begins daily at noon and continues until all but
nine players are eliminated. The game reconvenes at 4:00 p.m. the next day
and continues until one player wins all the chips.
There’s only one event for low rollers, and it’s free: the Press Invitational. This
event is designed to provide members of the working press a first-hand World
Series experience without putting any of their own money at risk. But risk and
reward are closely related in poker, and the $1,000 prize paid to each year’s
winning journalist pales in comparison to the $1.5 million that the winner of
the main event takes home. (Up until 1999, the big prize was $1 million.) That
main event is a $10,000 buy-in, No-Limit Texas Hold’em tournament. It’s the
Big Kahuna of all poker games, played out over four days in mid-May, and the
winner is regaled as poker’s world champion for the next 12 months.
How) It Att Got Started
The World Series of Poker began in 1970 as a small gathering of top poker pro-
fessionals invited to the Horseshoe by its owner, Benny Binion, to play a few
friendly games of poker at very high stakes. When the dust cleared, the assem-
blage cast votes for the player to be named world champion. Johnny Moss,
100
Part IN: Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms
who passed away in 1996 and was still a competitive force among poker
players in his 89th year, was chosen. Moss was a fitting choice, for it’s Johnny
Moss and his old friend Benny Binion who can take most of the credit for pop-
ularizing poker in Las Vegas.
Moss, the Grand Old Man of Poker, was an old-time Texas road gambler; a
breed made redundant by the proliferation of casinos and legalized poker
rooms. Back in 1949, however, Nevada was the only state that offered legal
gaming. That’s when legendary gambler Nick “the Greek” Dandalos came to
town. The Greek wanted to play no-limit poker, and he wanted to play against
a single opponent. Binion agreed to host the game, and there was no question
in his mind about the man for the job. He immediately called Johnny Moss,
who caught the next plane from Dallas, took a cab to Binion’s Horseshoe, and
sat down to a friendly game With Nick the Greek.
Binion positioned the table near the casino’s entrance, and the crowds—
intrigued by the biggest game the town had ever seen — stood five- and six-
deep to watch. The confrontation between Moss and Dandalos lasted five
months, punctuated by breaks for sleep every four days. In the end, Nick the
Greek, who had broken all the gamblers on the East Coast (including mobster
Arnold Rothstein), stood up from the table, smiled, and said: “Mr. Moss, I
have to let you go.” Over that five-month period Johnny Moss had beaten
Nick Dandalos for more than $2 million.
1970: The First World Series of Poker
In 1970, Binion decided to recapture that magic by inviting the top profes-
sionals to play in public. Five games were played at the inaugural World
Series of Poker, and Johnny Moss won them all. He won again in 1971; and
when he captured the title a third time in 1974, the legend of Johnny Moss
and the World Series of Poker were forever linked.
Since its relatively modest beginnings, the World Series of Poker has grown
exponentially. From five events in 1970, it’s become a 20-plus event tourna-
ment. The grand finale, the $10,000 buy-in, No-Limit Hold’em tournament,
attracts more than 400 participants each year, creating a prize pool that
exceeds $4 million in the process.
The 1997 winner, Stu Ungar, a professional poker player from Las Vegas, who
also won it in 1980 and 1981, walked away with a cool $1 million. The remain-
der of the prize money was distributed to the top 27 finishers according to
their order of finish. Since that time, each winner has received a first prize of
at least $1 million.

Real gaming at Glitter Gulch
If the World Series has grown by leaps and
bounds, so has Binion's — and downtown’s
Glitter Gulch along withit Once a shabby,dark,
narrow, incredibly noisy
casino, Binion's
expanded a few years ago to keep up with its
growing clientele. Binion's is always crowded.
It's justthatnow they can packmore customers
inside their expanded digs.
If Las Vegas has become more family-oriented
in recent years — Disneyland with gaming —
Binion's is whatit's always been:a gamblinghall
where there's no upper limit on your bets and no
ersatz pirate ships or erupting volcanoesto dis-
tract serious players.
Binion's formula obviouslyworked because the
casino expandedwhilemost of downtown stag-
nated. Expansion was easy.The Binion family
purchased the Mint Hotel and Casino located
next door,tore downthe walls and doubledtheir
capacity overnight.In addition,the downtown
casinos — together with the City of Las Vegas
and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors
Authority — jointly financed construction of a
latticelike archway that runs the length of
Fremont Street. During the day, the archway
tames the desert sun. At night,more than 2mil-
lion lights,controlled by 121 computers and 208
speakers,create an extravagantlight andsound

High-Rotter Tournaments Made
A ffordable
When gaming expanded to Atlantic City, Connecticut, Mississippi, and much
of the Midwest, Las Vegas kept ahead of the curve by continuing to reinvent
itself — and the World Series of Poker was no exception. The tournament’s
early years were restrictive, since one had to be a high roller to enter.
Democratization came in the 1980s with the advent of satellite tournaments.
(See Chapter 10 for details about these mini-tournaments.) Satellite tourna-
ments give everyone an opportunity to compete in big buy-in events. Not
only is it possible to parlay a $220 satellite entry fee into victory in the main
event, it’s been done. In fact, when Tom McEvoy defeated Rod Peate for the
title in 1983, it marked the first time two players parlayed satellite victories
into a shot at the championship. “It’s like taking a toothpick,” said 1972
champ Amarillo Slim Preston, “and turning it into a lumber yard.”
But the tournament events are not the entire story: non-stop side games
exude high energy and big money. Betting limits of $400-$800 are common.
Surrounded by smoke, green felt, cards, the clacking of chips riffled through
the fingers of some 600 players, you realize that this is poker’s equivalent of a
feeding frenzy: games ’round the clock, contestants playing at double and
triple their usual stakes, and top pros from all over the world competing
against each other in Las Vegas’s biggest games. After all, when you’re a pro-
fessional poker player who’s been knocked out of today’s tournament event,
what are you going to do until tomorrow? You’re gonna play poker. What else?

Just how big has the World Series of Poker
(WSOP) become? Bythe end of the last century,
morethan 4,000 entrants were entering annually
to contest more than $12.25 million in prize
money, and new records for the number of
entries were being established regularly. (The
WSOP is composed of about 20 events, with an
average of 200 entrants per event The prize
moneyfor the main eventtotalsalmost$4 million.)
The internationalization of poker became over-
whelmingly apparent at the 1997 World Series,
with 12 of the 21 events won by foreign-born
players. In 1999, the last World Series of Poker
to be playedinthe 20th century,the $10,000 buy-
in No-Limit Texas Hold'em tournament — the
main event of the World Series — had 393
entrants.
Noel Furlong, who won the
1999 World
Championship,hailsfromIreland.So do Padraig
Parkinson, who finished third, and George
McKeever, who was seventh. Chris Bigler, the
fifth-place finisher, is Swiss. With Europeans
capturing four of the first seven places in the
main event in 1999, it's clear that poker is truly
an international game. In addition to the Irish
and Swiss finalists,final-table finishersin other
events that year hailed from England, Germany,
Italy, and Australia.
It's not just a guy thing either. Women have also
come into their own as formidable competitors.
Three women — Linda Johnson, Maria Stern,
and Susie Isaacs — won open-event titles in
recent years. Maria Stem is also part of another
unique record: She and her husband, Dr. Max
Stem,are the only couple in World Serieshistory
to both win titles; they did it in 1997. After each
won a tide,Dr. Stemcaptured a second eventfor

Championship two years in a row and wrote her
own poker book, MsPoker.
No-Limit Terns Hold’em — the Cadillac
of Card Games
Popularized in part by the World Series of Poker, Texas Hold’em was always
the game of choice for Southern road gamblers. Now, most poker players
prefer Hold’em. Part of the popularity of Hold’em is that it’s faster than Stud ,
there’s more action, and there’s no need to rack one’s brain memorizing
exposed cards and folded hands.
Hold’em is a deceptively simple game. Two players to the dealer’s left must
post blind bets — before seeing their hands — and each player is dealt two
cards face down. Acting in turn, players may either fold, call, or raise the
blind bet.
Three cards are turned face up in the center of the table, and another round
of betting takes place. These face-up cards are communal cards — called the
flop — and players use their two private cards in conjunction with the com-
munal cards to make the best possible poker hand. Two more communal
Chapter 12:The World Series of Poker
cards— the turn and the river— are dealt face up, with a round of betting
after each. When a hand is concluded, the dealer position and blinds rotate
clockwise around the table.
In tournaments, blinds increase at prescribed intervals to stimulate action
and to adjust to the higher chip count of the remaining players.
Most Hold’em games are played with betting limits. In a recreational $3-$6
game you may bet or raise in $3 increments before and on the flop, and bet or
raise in $6 increments on the turn and river. If you are raised, it will cost
another $6 to call.
But No-Limit Hold’em is altogether different. Each entrant at the World Series
starts with $10,000 in tournament chips and can bet any amount at any time.
Imagine yourself in a no-limit game. You might bet $100 only to confront a
raiser who pushes his entire stack of chips toward the center of the table. If
his chip count is equal to or greater than yours, you must move all-in to call.
Fold, and you’ve relinquished any claim to the pot. Call, and it’s all over until
next year if your hand is beaten. It’s a daunting decision. No-Limit Hold’em is
both a game of cat and mouse— each player trying to trap an opponent for
all his chips — as well as a game of well-timed bluffs and aggression.
Suppose the pot contains $500 and your opponent bets $2,000. What does
that mean? Does she have the goods or is she bluffing? Does she have an
unbeatable hand and is betting in hopes that yours is almost as good? Or is it
a naked bluff? Certainty is rare in No-Limit Hold’em— and that’s why the
great Hold’em players all tell you that heart is more important than knowing
odds and working the numbers. In No-Limit, everyone tries to steal the pot —
you really can’t win in the long run if you don’t — but the best pull it off
adroitly. The mediocre are routinely caught — snapped o f f\ as they say at the
table — and left to stagger away talking to themselves.
In a limit game, by comparison, all it will cost is a single bet if you are raised,
and because you know that, your risk is predictable. In no-limit, your entire
stack of chips is always in jeopardy. At the end of four days each year’s world
champion may have made a mistake or two over the course of this tourna-
ment but was lucky enough to draw out on his opponents, or — and this is
much more likely — he outplayed them at critical junctures.
Let’s Get Ready to Rumble: The Latest
Battles at the World Series of Poker
The main event is what draws the crowds to Las Vegas, and the 1997 and
1998 World Series of Poker were more dramatic than most. One event is the
thrilling yet ultimately sad tale of an incredible comeback, the other a quin-
tessential American success story.

Stu Unqar: The Comeback Kid
A dozen former world champs competed in the 1997 event, including two-
time winners Doyle Brunson, Johnny Chan, and Stu Ungar, along with 27-year-
old defending champion Huck Seed. Formerly an engineering student at Cal
Tech, Seed took a year’s sabbatical to play poker and never returned.
When Norway’s Tormod Roren was eliminated late on the evening of the third
day of competition, only six contestants remained, setting the stage for the
final table, to be played outdoors on Fremont Street the next day. Stadium
seating for the general public was erected under the curved , lattice-like space
frame of the Fremont Street Experience. Bleachers had also replaced card
tables in Binion’s tournament,area, and crews were laying cable and wheeling
in big-screen TVs to provide additional viewing for the main event.
The six remaining contestants for poker’s biggest prize took their seats at the
table shortly after 10:00 Thursday morning, and ESPN colorman Gabe Kaplan
conducted short, “up-close-and-personal” interviews with each finalist:

professional poker player. But Bob, according to Kaplan, specializes in
cash games, and this marked the first time he had entered a major poker
tournament.

Ron Stanley, 44 years old at the time, was dressed for the occasion in a
tuxedo— with black-and-white baseball cap to match. He is a Las Vegas
pro who had accumulated World Series earnings of more than $326,000.
Stu Ungar completed the field. Once known as “The Kid,” he stunned the
poker world in 1980 and 1981 when, as a 27-year-old, he captured the
title two years in a row. Coming into this event he had already won more
than $1 million at the Horseshoe’s annual poker tournament, and he was
once regarded by knowledgeable insiders as one of the top poker play-
ers in the world. In addition, he was generally acknowledged to be the
best gin rummy player in history. But tough times, drug addiction, and
health problems beset Ungar in recent years, and this tournament
1
marked a comeback of sorts for him.
Chapter 12: The World Series of Poker
The generally accepted wisdom among the punters was that Ungar — who
began the day with a chip lead of almost $400,000 over Ron Stanley, his near-
est competitor— would sit quietly and let others eliminate themselves
before moving into the fray with guns blazing. But Ungar’s reputation was not
built on passivity; it centered on two critical skills: Unrelenting aggression in
suitable situations, and an uncanny ability to read his opponents and know
with near certainty what cards they were playing. When Ungar was on top of
his game, it almost seemed like his opponents were playing their cards face
up— while his were disguised and unfathomable.
ah!*
®e*-
Ungar attacked early and often. His opponents frequently folded. Tournament
poker differs from normal games in one very significant way: You're not
wagering money in a tournament so much as you are betting a portion of yourt
total equity in the game. For Ungar, with his huge chip lead, a bet of $20,000
represented only 2 percent of the $1 million or so in chips that was stacked
on the table in front of him. For the short-stacked Peter Bao, $20,000 repre-
sented ten times that amount.
No one wanted to be the first player eliminated. The sixth place finisher
would receive $127,200 — not a bad payday, but substantially less than fifth
place, which would be awarded $162,120. Fourth place would earn $212,000,
while third place was worth $371,000. Second place paid $583,000, while the
winner was slated to walk away with a cool $1 million. At each fork in the
road, staying alive was a far better alternative than elimination, and survival
meant avoiding a confrontation with Ungar, the chip leader.
At one point Ungar raised seven hands in a row. No one called. Was he bluffing?
Of course he was— some of the time. Everyone knew that. But no one knew
when. Every contestant hoped one of his opponents would be eliminated first.
It didn’t matter which one. Every time someone was knocked out, the surviving
players climbed another rung on the pay ladder. Ungar knew that.
Ungar’s mastery of the table seemed palpable. He was a shark among a
school of fish, and he sensed blood in the water. Bao, short on chips the
entire day, was the first to fall — eliminated by Judah. By 1:30 p.m. Ungar had
more chips than his remaining four opponents combined.
Ungar’s biggest competitor was fellow Las Vegas pro Ron Stanley, sitting in
second place. But five minutes later an incredible event took place. Stanley
raised Strzemp, putting him all-in. Stanley had a pair of kings; Strzemp a pair
of 10s. The flop helped no one, and Stanley was a huge favorite to win that
pot. But the turn brought forth a miracle card, one of the two remaining 10s
in the deck, giving Strzemp trip 10s. The river card was a blank, and Stanley
stared at the table in shock. When Judah announced that he discarded a 10,
Stanley knew he suffered what poker players call a bad beat. Only one card
remaining in the deck could have won the hand for Strzemp and he caught it.
After the flop, with two cards to come, Strzemp’s chances of catching the
lone remaining 10 were less than 5 percent. He faced elimination as a 22-to-l
long shot and survived!
195
Part III: Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms
By 2:00 p.m. Ungar held 60 percent of all the chips in play, and his aggression
showed no signs of relenting. None of his opponents appeared willing to
settle for a fifth place finish, since fourth place paid $50,000 more. Fifteen
minutes later the stalemate was broken when Judah’s humble pair of 2s
proved strong enough to eliminate Bob Walker, who flopped four to a straight
and four to a flush. But neither hand materialized, and the war of attrition
claimed another victim.
Shaken from the bad beat that Strzemp administered — as well as an earlier
incident when Ungar bluffed him out of a $200,000 pot and then flipped his
cards face up on the table as if to show the world just what he was capable of
doing— Stanley was eliminated when he ran into Strzemp’s full house. Three
contestants now remained at the final table, but only for a moment.
Dangerously low on chips, Judah was eliminated when he lost a pot to Ungar.
After a short break it was Ungar against Strzemp— heads-up( just two play-
ers), During the break, Jack Binion, accompanied by eight very large security
guards, carried a box filled with $1 million in hundred-dollar bills to the table,
to await the outcome of the final confrontation. Ten minutes later Strzemp
made a big bet. Ungar deliberated for what seemed like an excessively long
time. He riffled chips through his fingers. He glanced furtively at Strzemp, peer-
ing over the tops of his bright blue sunglasses, trying to read him, trying to
catch any sort of sign — or tell, as poker players call it— that would provide
the clue he was looking for. Suddenly he snapped erect and pushed his chips
toward the center of the pot, putting Strzemp all-in. Since there could be no
more betting, both players turned their hands face up.Strzemp held A-8;
Ungar A-4.
The dealer turned the flop over. It was A-3-5. Each player had a pair of aces,
but Strzemp’s side card put him in the lead. The turn was another 3. Now
each player had two pair: As and 3s. But Strzemp’s hand was A-A-3-3-8, while
Ungar’s side card was redundant.
Everyone knew the odds. If the last communal card was a 5, 6, or 7, Strzemp
would win the pot since his side card would be bigger than the unpaired card
on the board. He’d also win if the last card was an 8, since it would give him
As and 8s to Ungar’s As and 3s. If the river card was a 9 or higher, the pot
would be split since both side cards— Ungar’s 4 and Strzemp’s 8— would be
obviated by the higher communal river card. Ungar could win only if the river
card was a 4— giving him As and 4s against Strzemp’s As and 3s — or a 2,
which would complete his straight.
The river card was a 2. Strzemp seemed crushed, and Ungar elated. Stu Ungar,
now 43 years old and no longer “The Kid” who won it two years running in 1980
and 1981, captured poker’s biggest prize for the third time. In doing so, he dom-
inated a field of world-class professionals and top-notch big-money players
from North America, Europe, South America, and Asia in the process.

But Ungar’s day in the sun was short-lived. A few months later a lifetime of
bad habits caught up with him. The man acknowledged as the best gin
rummy player in history, and quite possibly the best no-limit poker player of
all time, was found dead in a Las Vegas hotel room. Too many years of drug
use and attendant health problems had taken their toll, and a man with talent
as big as the mountains would never make another comeback.
Scotty Nguyen: An American dreamer
To win the 1998 World Series of Poker, Scotty Nguyen, a seasoned professional
poker player who was used to competing in big money games against very
tough competition, had to overcome a field of some 350 players. Each competi-
tor ponied up $10,000 to enter this tournament, a four-day event that guaran-
teed the winner a cash payment of a cool million dollars. Nguyen had done well
earlier in the World Series. After placing third in the $2,000 No-Limit Hold’em
event, he vowed that
44 . . . you’ll see me at more final tables here in the
Horseshoe.”
At the moment he defeated runner up Kevin McBride after some 3%-hours of
heads-up play, Nguyen — once given the nickname “The Prince” — became
poker’s king.
But it wasn’t always bright lights, million-dollar payouts, and all the glitz of
poker’s premier event for Scotty Nguyen. Flash back to 1979. A 17-year-old
Thuan Nguyen and his younger brother decide to escape from the Vietnam
war zone he was raised in. The decision to flee was, by far, a bigger gamble
than any he’d encounter at a $10,000 buy-in poker tournament, and one that
almost cost the brothers their lives. He recounts the story of near death in the
ocean, of running out of gas, and nearly running out of food, his younger
brother so near death that 17-year-old Thuan — not yet “Scotty,” and not quite
“The Prince” — had to hand-feed him to keep him alive.

Then the miracle at sea occurred. The boys were picked up by a Taiwanese
boat and placed in a refugee camp. They finally got a sponsor and then
entered the United States. After a year in Chicago, which young Thuan found
too cold for his liking, Nguyen relocated to Orange County, California, the
West Coast’s center for Vietnamese immigration.
Now 19 years old and a recent graduate of Costa Mesa High School, Nguyen
and some friends went to Las Vegas on a lark. Nguyen decided the town was
for him. Not one to waste a minute, he walked up to the manager of the
restaurant where they were eating and said, “1 need a job; I’ll do anything.”
Asked if he could start tomorrow, he did not even return to California to pick
up his belongings. Instead he found a room to stay in. It wasn’t the Ritz by
any means. At times there weVe five to seven others staying there too. He bor-
rowed clothes, slept on the floor and then on a couch, which “ ... finally
broke in half after a year.” An inauspicious beginning to be sure, but it is the
stuff American dreams are made of. An immigrant boy becomes very much
the American and makes good. It was during his bus-boy, crash-pad days that
he became “Scotty.” The restaurant manager, who couldn’t remember
Nguyen’s real name, pinned “Scotty” on him. Nguyen liked it; the name stuck,
and he’s been “Scotty” ever since.
In his spare time Scotty studied poker. He read books and watched the big
money games that were then held at the Stardust. By now he had moved into
his own apartment, but found the career of a busboy financially limiting. He
took his developing love of poker and enrolled in dealer’s school. In 1983,
shortly after his twenty-first birthday, Scotty began dealing poker.
Scotty learned poker from watching the big-money games at the Stardust.
Vowing not to make the same mistakes he saw other players make, he quit
his job and began playing poker full time. He was now a full-time poker player
and a winner from the start. He played daily. He won a big tournament but
couldn’t handle the success. He gave money away and lost the rest at the
craps table. By 1988 he was broke and had to take a job dealing poker at the
Golden Nugget.
This time, however, there was a silver lining in Scotty’s black cloud and her
name was Dawn. “The first time 1 laid eyes on her I fell in love,” said Scotty
The feeling was mutual. The romance blossomed, the couple married, and
today are the parents of Anthony, Brittney, Courtney, and Jade.
But life was a financial roller-coaster ride for the Nguyens. Scotty would win.
Scotty would go broke. Dawn gave him money and friends helped out when
times were tough. But Dawn believed in Scotty and he believed in himself.
After all, he had conquered much more than poker in just getting to America,
and he was determined not to fail now. He worked at his game. He studied. He
persevered. His game improved. Gradually he became a consistent winner.
Chapter 12:The World Series of Poker 199
Nguyen began playing in.small tournaments and by 1995 he cashed in his first
World Series of Poker, when he placed thirteenth in a $2,500 limit Hold’em
event. The following year he won two events at the Queens Poker Classic,
where he was nicknamed “The Prince” by one of the tournament employees.
“The Prince” is a nickname that’s as prophetic as it was popular with Scotty,
for today he’s counted among poker’s royalty. But it wasn’t easy for him. It
never has been. The Big Kahuna, the $10,000 buy-in, No-Limit Hold’em cham-
pionship is never a walk in the park, not even when you’ve gone from rags to
riches. It’s never easy, even when your life’s experiences include very nearly
dying at sea as a 17-year-old in a mad dash to freedom. It’s never easy when
you come to America and find yourself sleeping seven-to-a-room while labor-
ing as a bus boy. Dealing poker isn’t easy either, and neither is playing profes-
sionally — particularly when you go broke regularly and have to rely on your
wife’s earnings and the kindness of friends to keep you afloat.
But overcoming struggle is the defining characteristic of the American immi-
grant. It’s the fuel that energized our nation and forged our character in a cru-
cible of dreams. And, ultimately, it was that strength that enabled Scotty
Nguyen to win the 1998 World Series of Poker. But it wasn’t easy.
The championship is a four-day marathon, not a sprint. Three-hundred and
fifty players entered. By the start of the last day all but five had been elimi-
nated. Scotty Nguyen was the chip leader, with $1,184,000, trailed by new-
comer Kevin McBride with $873,000. T. J. Cloutier, Card Player Magazine's
Player of the Year for 1998, was in third place with $829,000. Dewey Weum, a
veteran of the poker wars from Monona, Wisconsin, and San Diego’s Lee
Salem trailed with $376,000 and $240,000, respectively.
Short on chips, Salem and Weum are eliminated within two hours. Now the
game is three-handed. Cloutier, a former professional football player consid-
ered by many to be the best tournament player in the world, has yet to win
the big one. He won’t this year, either.
On the 157th hand of the final day, McBride raises $40,000 from the small blind.
Cloutier reraises $120,000 and McBride calls. The flop is 4*547*. Cloutier bets
his remaining $400,000. McBride ponders, but calls.Since Cloutier is all-in, the
players turn their cards over. Cloutier holds K 4Q*. McBride, incredibly, has
just called a $400,000 bet with J*9* — only a flush draw. The next card is a J*,
giving McBride a pair of jacks. But Cloutier still has hope. A king or a queen
that does not make McBride’s flush will win it for T. J. But the river card is the
2v — a complete blank — and Cloutier is eliminated.
Now it is heads-up, and McBride, with $2,207,000 to Scotty’s $1,293,000, has
63 percent of the chips in play. It’s a big lead, but not insurmountable, and
McBride’s chip lead is, to some degree, offset by Scotty’s extensive tourna-
ment experience. McBride, after all, is a newcomer. He’s a rags-to-riches story
200
Part III:Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms
himself — at least as far as this tournament is concerned. He entered a $220
satellite, won a buy-in to the main event, and now finds himself heads-up—
with a chip lead — for the World Championship.
Scotty Nguyen, like most top-notch tournament players, has a reputation for
aggressive play. But on this day the heads-up match is more like a chess
game. Like two fighters with dynamite in their fists, they probe and parry —
respectful, if not wary, of each other’s punching power. They dart in and dart
out — again and again — each unwilling to make an error that would severely
cripple or knock him out of the tournament altogether.
They play heads-up for nearly four hours. It’s a very long time by past World
Series standards. Gradually, Scotty edges into the lead, only to lose it back on
the 184th hand when a seemirigly innocuous 3* on the last card gives
McBride a full house. He now has $1.9 million to Nguyen’s $1.6 million.
Sixteen hands later Nguyen is in the lead again. The chip count stands at $2.5
million to $1 million. But McBride is a warrior and it’s not over yet. On the
251st hand, both men call. The flop is 3+4+A4. Scotty bets $30,000 and
McBride calls. The turn card is the 4*. McBride calls Nguyen’s $80,000 bet.
The last card is the 9v. When Scotty bets $200,000 McBride raises $386,000.
He is now all-in. He immediately gets up and leaves the room. Five minutes
later he returns from his pit stop.
“It’s all over if 1 read you right,” says Nguyen. But Scotty reads him wrong and
McBride, who is holding 4*54 in his hand is back in the chase after his trip
4s skewers Scotty’s AvQ*. But Nguyen makes no more mistakes, and after
letting his opponent back in the game, he rebuilds his stack of chips to $2.9
million — while McBride labors with $600,000.
On the 268th hand, with the blinds at $25,000 and $50,000, the end comes.
McBride raises $50,000 before the flop and Nguyen calls. The flop is 8+949v.
Scotty checks and calls McBride’s $100,000 bet. The next card is the 8v .
Nguyen checks, and McBride, who is holding QvlOv and has a draw to a
straight flush, bets $100,000. Scotty calls. When the 84 falls on the river,
Scotty moves all-in saying, “If you call, it’s gonna be all over.”
Kevin McBride later stated that Scotty’s comment was what got him to call.
He thought Scotty was using table talk in an attempt to get him to relinquish
his hand. This time, however, it was McBride who read Nguyen wrong and
called with the remainder of his chips, saying, “I’m playing the board.” But
Scotty Nguyen, holding J49+ won the pot, and the 1998 World Series of
Poker, with nines full of eights (9-9-9-8-8).
It was nearly 5:00 in the evening as the 35-year-old immigrant from Vietnam
posed with Jack Binion in front of what was now his: $1 million.

fm f you’re serious about improving your poker skills— especially if you’re a
Jl beginner — you need to get cozy with a personal computer. Here’s why:
The union of poker and computer technology offers an opportunity to jump-
start your poker progress and move up the learning curve with ease. Playing
poker on your PC will also save you money: Dump those beginner boo-boos
before they cost you dearly in real games!
Today’s poker students can use a personal computer as the cornerstone of a
comprehensive, interactive self-study course in poker. If you study poker
books and use a computer to practice your newfound skills, you can leapfrog
past the anguish and expense of gaining experience the old-fashioned way
(by losing your greenhorn’s money to the sharks).
With a PC you can try out your fledgling poker skills in games against surpris-
ingly tough computer opponents. On the Internet you can play against human
opponents for play-money or even real money, gaining valuable experience
for live casino play
Once online, you participate in the newsgroup r e c. g a m b l i n g. p o k e r (RGP)
and other sites dedicated strictly to poker. Here you will find stimulating dis-
cussions to sharpen your thinking and deepen your understanding. You’ll
receive feedback from more experienced players, including experts, and you’ll
be able to get information about games anywhere in the world.

Choosing the Right Computer for
Poker Studg
What, you don’t have a computer yet but are thinking of taking the plunge?
Do you have an old computer and wonder if you can get by? If you don’t have
a computer, now is the time to get one. Anyone serious about becoming a
consistent winner in poker is handicapped without a PC. Whenever you sit in
a game for cash stakes, you’ll be facing opponents who use computers for
poker study.
Some of those players are even doing computer simulations to discover the
lifetime results of playing thesame hand several different ways. The latest
PCs can handle this chore in less time than it takes you to watch a movie—
and we’re talking about three million hands or so! Do you really want your
competitors to have this kind of resource at their fingertips when you don’t?
Getting by With a used computer
Okay, we’ve convinced you — you need a computer. But remember, it can’t
be just any PC. The dinosaur your brother-in-law dumped on your front lawn
ten years ago when his pizza business went under just won’t make the grade,
nor will most computers that are more than a few years old.
Realistic computer poker has arrived, but you have to meet it head-on with
the right equipment. Advances in computers in just the past year or two have
already left earlier models dead in the water, matching the astounding
advances in poker software step for step.
Computers just aren’t like cars. An old, well-maintained PC may be okay for
your bookkeeping, but it won’t have the pickup and speed you need on the
Internet superhighway, nor will it have “the right stuff ” to cope with the com-
plex graphics of quality poker programs. Assigning an old computer to
handle these tasks is not like putting an old car on the freeway, but more like
putting a hay wagon out there! Trying to get somewhere on the Internet? You
may get there, but you won’t like the bumpy ride!
Face it. If you’re serious about improving your poker skills and have a com-
puter more than a few years old, you probably need to replace it, unless
you’re a computer whiz who is capable of doing lots of fancy upgrades. Keep
your blood pressure somewhere beneath the stratosphere by turning it in for
a new model.
Chapter 13:The Computer: Your Shortcut to Poker Mastery
Our final word: Buy new if you possibly can. The ease, speed, and conve-
nience offered by the latest computers are worth it. Most new computers will
have most — if not all — of the following accoutrements already built-in, but
it doesn’t hurt to check.
For the computer activities we recommend in this and the following chapter,
you’ll avoid problems by having at least . ..
| v* The Windows 95 (or higher if you’re buying new) operating system.
(Poker program designers love Windows. In fact, many poker programs
won’t work with anything but Windows. Don’t try to swim upstream by
buying a Macintosh!)
|
»
| i* A Pentium-class (or equivalent) processor incorporating MMX technql-
I
ogy (which improves a computer’s ability to run complex stuff like videos
and the sophisticated graphics of today’s realistic poker programs).
| *
64 megabytes or more of RAM (random access memory). Poker pro-
t
grams are greedy — they eat up lots of computer memory space, espe-
|
cially when you’re playing on the Internet.
I ^ A modem with a minimum speed of 33,600 bits per second (bps).
56,800 bps is even better (A modem is a device that enables a computer
to send and receive data through an ordinary phone line.)
Note: You may see the numbers written as 33.6Kbps or 56Kbps, with the
I
K standing for kilo (thousand). The faster your modem connection, the
easier it will be to use the Internet.
I v0 A sound card so you can hear neat things like the clacking of chips
when the pot is pushed to you; the warning beep when it’s your turn to
l
act and you’re buried in the sports pages; or the canned laughter of your
opponents when you do something dumb.
|v* A CD-ROM or DVD drive for installing poker software and other pro-
grams, and for playing cool music to calm your nerves when the poker
I
god is smiling everywhere but in your direction.
Using a Computer for Interactive
Poker Practice
In the past, you could learn the nuts and bolts of poker quickly, but you could
get experience — that old beginner’s bugaboo— only through the school of
hard knocks. There was no comprehensive, integrated poker course for
beginners. You just had to run the gauntlet of costly errors at the tables and
take your lumps. Period.
205
:I

Part III: Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms
Then poker books came on the scene, making things a lot easier for those
willing to study them. By using this book and others we recommend in a con-
tinuous cycle of reading, studying, playing, and thinking, you’ll have a real leg
up on the competition. Videos and seminars will help, too. And do discuss
your play with experienced friends!
Still, poker, like musical performance, is a hands-on activity. No matter how
much you study and prepare for it, you must actually play to improve.
There’s just no way around it.
You must interact with other players, too. Poker is, after all, an interactive
activity. In music, you can become a big-shot soloist superstar, playing mer-
rily away in the limelight, generating big bucks by your lonesome. To become
a poker star, you must constantly interact with other players while monitor-
ing and adjusting your own play. That’s how you improve!
The best poker books and other learning aids can give you a solid framework
for winning play. They cannot give you the extensive hands-on, interactive
game experience you need. A computer can! A PC can provide three types of
interactive play:
|v0 In interactive poker software games, a computer functions simultane-
ously as instructor/guide, practice opponent(s), and progress assessor.
|
There’s no financial risk, and you can practice to your heart’s content at
no cost beyond the initial cost of the software. Most importantly, you’ll
improve constantly.
£
(Don’t think you’ll have it easy playing against the computer opponents,
either Some are even tough enough to give experts a run for their money!)
|v0 Linked to the Internet, your computer can bring you play-money games
I
in which you will compete against live opponents. The other players will
be much like you, just wanting to learn and have fun. You’ll be able to
“chat” with them as you play by typing messages on your keyboards
back and forth. There are no financial risks, but there may be a nominal
I
fee for using the Internet site. (And some sites are absolutely free.)
£
Your computer can link you to Internet poker casinos where you can
play against real people for real money! Keep in mind that this is no
%
longer practice, but real poker! Consider the pros and cons of this care-
fully before getting involved. (We help you take a hard look at this
option in Chapter 14.)
An Interactive Self-Study Course
Interactive computer software games and Internet play-money poker games
are the heart of a comprehensive self-study course. They get your head out of
poker books and get your game off the ground.
L.
Chapter 13: The Computer: Your Shortcut to Poker Mastery 207
But wait! You don’t get to.abandon those books— ever! You’ll be reading and
rereading them throughout your poker career. They’ll also be valuable while
you cut your teeth on computer poker games. Nobody will see you sneak a
peek at a hand-ranking start chart or look up the chapter that tells whether
you really should have reraised with four players yet to act behind you. Keep
those books handy.
Be creative! Mix it up! Read a paragraph, play a hand. Walk the dog. Think
about the hands you just played. Get some coffee. Think some more. Read
that chapter on short-handed play, then set up a short-handed game. Play
some hands. Reread the chapter. Play more hands. Get the idea?
Think of your self-study Course as a three-legged stool:
i
p v* From a choice selection of poker books you can learn everything from
|
the bare-bones essentials of poker to advanced theories. That’s one leg.
)S The second leg is a quality computer poker software program in which
you’ll play against computer opponents and work on specific problems.
As a supplement, you can play in mock games for play-money against
human opponents on the Internet (whenever you just have to know
there are real folks out there).
v0 The final leg is the lively interchange of ideas and opinions you’ll find in an
online newsgroup dedicated to poker. By participating frequently in
rec. gambling . poker (RGP), you’ll grow by leaps and bounds in your
understanding of the theoretical and psychological elements of poker.
You’ll even have a ready-made audience whenever things aren’t going well!
Take a look at each of these three essential components. (This chapter intro-
duces you to the extraordinary learning opportunity of interactive software.
We examine Internet poker games and RGP in the next chapter.)
Interactive Poker Software Programs
Computer poker programs have come of age. The best programs offer interac-
tive learning opportunities that were unavailable only a few years ago.
Improved versions are hurtling down the pipeline at warp speed, each leaving
its predecessor light-years behind. The realism of contemporary programs
has largely negated statements made by poker gurus only a few years ago:
“I suspect poker is just too difficult a game to program reasonably well,”
wrote one expert in 1996. At about the same time, another expert wrote that
computer opponents were unable to learn from events in previous hands
when making decisions, something a human player always does (or should).

To do the most good, your practice sessions should be done under condi-
tions approaching real play. The latest poker software offers the realistic
game context you need to improve. Computer opponents have evolved, and
so have other features.
Reviewers are now saying — half seriously — that they’d like to put some of
the computer opponents in real games for real cash.
These new cyberopponents — with their ability to bluff and semi-bluff , slow-
play and checkraise, can do all of the following:
u* Make adjustments for position and number of players
J* Alter strategy when che^kraised
^ React to events in prior hands
v0 Take their share of pots and leave you muttering
No doubt that they’ll prepare you for real games.
Finding the best software
Tracking down the best software is easy. Just check out the highly regarded
Turbo Poker series by Wilson Software. Poker experts and satisfied cus-
tomers almost unanimously praise this software series for its realism and
overall quality. Wilson Software offers these games:
i* Turbo Seven-Card Stud
v* Turbo Omaha High Only
^ Turbo Omaha High-Low Split
u* Turbo Texas Hold’em
v* Turbo Stud 8/or Better
v* Tournament Texas Hold’em
All of these games require the Windows operating system (sorry, Macintosh
users). For more information on the offerings by Wilson software, visit its
Web site at www . wi 1 sonsw. com or call 1-800-735-4430.
Using the offerings from Wilson Software
Program installation is remarkably easy and takes only a few minutes. You
don’t even need to restart your computer.
Chapter 13: The Computer: Your Shortcut to Poker Mastery 209
(§j
The games are user-friendly. After a simple and speedy installation process
that all but directs itself, you can be absorbed in a game within minutes. Feel
free to plunge in!
Once you start a program, you can simply click the Help button at the top of
the screen. It will bring up an index to detailed instructions, including how to
start a game.
At the top of the program screen you’ll find five or six buttons. Click the
button called Game Setup, and familiarize yourself with the options you find
there. You’ll be able to structure each new game as you see fit: number of
players, toughness of computer opponents, blinds or antes, betting limits,
number of raises permitted per round, and many other variables. It’s well
worth your while to explore all these options thoroughly. Type in your prefer-
ences and then start your first game. Get those cards in the air!
One option deserves special mention if you lose interest in any hand. Click
Modify Game SettingsOGame SetupOAlways zip to the end. By “zipping to
the end,” you immediately see the showdown result each time you fold. Then
click Deal and you’re on to the next hand!
You can also zip manually by clicking on Zip at the bottom of the screen.
Don’t like your hand after the flop? Zip! Missed the flop again? Zip! More
lousy cards? Zip, zip! Fun, isn’t it?
Hmmm . .. should you call or raise? Need some advice here? Just click
Advice. A disembodied voice accompanied by onscreen hand analysis steers
you in the right direction. You get a warning if you make a play that the advi-
sor doesn’t like (unless you turn off this feature before you begin).
Want to know the odds against making your hand? You guessed it — click
Odds for a detailed analysis. Think you misplayed the hand and want to see
what would have happened if you had raised? Click Replay Play it again, Sam!
The latest versions of the games offer “tips,” which pop up automatically
when you start a program. Read them carefully. It’s a good idea when you’re
first starting out to read a group of them by clicking on Next at the bottom of
each tip in turn until you’ve read as many as you can absorb for that session.
These tips will give you a good idea of the program’s scope and possibilities.
Once you start a game, you can return to reading tips at any time by clicking
on the Tips button at the top of the screen.
A comprehensive user’s guide typically comes with each program. Don’t be
intimidated — you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to glean what you need
from it. If you’re a poker greenhorn, your objective is to just get playing,
which you can do simply by using the Help and Tips buttons. (Be sure to
read the manual. Just don’t get bogged down in the technical stuff when
you’re first starting!)

Part III:Computers,Casinos,and Cardrooms
Getting lots of practice quickly
Here’s another fabulous timesaver available in some of the Wilson Software
programs. Once you set up a game and click to start it, a screen instantly
pops up to ask whether you want to be dealt random hands, hands worth at
least a call, or strictly raising hands. (Now don’t you just wish you could do
that in a real game?)
The zipping and hand-skipping features enable you to play 60,000 hands—
the equivalent of a full year’s play in a live game at 30 hands per hour, eight
hours per day — in a quarter of that time (or less). It’s a lot like typing; you’ll
get faster and faster as you practice. How many hands can you play per hour?
Except for those hands you elect to play out, your speed will be limited
mostly by how fast you can/dick that mouse.
Playing at a higher letfet
When you’re comfortable playing poker on the computer, tackle these
techniques — and tackle them sooner rather than later because they’re not
difficult:
u* To see how well you’re doing, click Stats at the bottom of the screen. On
the list of options that appears, click Play Evaluation to see colorful
charts that assess your overall play and your play at each betting level
versus the play of the programmed advisor. If there are clear areas of
weakness in your game, you can pinpoint them here. Then explore the
garden of informative charts, graphs, and tables tucked behind other
Stats options.
| v* Over the course of an hour or so, play only A-A, say, in Hold’em or play
A-K-Q-J in Omaha High, or a hidden high pair in Stud by clicking Game
|
SetupOStack the Deck. You’ll gain experience in a variety of situations—
experience that might take you a year or more to accumulate in real
games. In each practice session, work on different hands. Keep a chart
of acceptable starting hands handy and work methodically through it
over a number of sessions.
^ Like to practice playing only the big blind, small blind, or button? Find
yourself calling too often in early position? To toughen up your play
where it’s weakest, click Modify Game Settings^Freeze the Button to
indulge yourself in an orgy of same-position play.
u* Combine the Stack the Deck option with Freeze the Button. Play A-K in the
big blind for only several rounds, then on the button, and so on. (Create
parallel situations in Omaha with four cards.) You can also stack the flop,
turn, and river cards (and opponents’ hands, as well) to replicate hands
from books you study, or to replay the hands of your worst nightmares.
& Most beginners would rather sit in a full-handed game than play short-
handed. Learn to profit from shorthanded games the easy way — make
them a staple of your practice sessions. Don’t forget to reduce the rake
(the portion of each pot taken by the house)! ( Yes, you can do that, too!)
Chapter 13: The Computer: Your Shortcut to Poker Mastery 211
Figure out how to modify the preprogrammed computer opponents,
create new ones, and use both in combination with high-speed simula-
tions to do your own poker research.
beating With computer opponents
Here’s where you can really be creative! Remember the fun you had mixing
paints or building blocks or modeling clay when you were a kid? There was
always a thrill in creating something new, wasn’t there?
Using the options available under Profile in most programs, you can do the
following:
t
i
u* You can modify playing styles of the 40 or so imaginatively and often
humorously named cyberopponents.
You can also create new ones by blending preprogrammed profile char-
acteristics of the originals. (The originals are never lost, however — just
temporarily altered or borrowed. They revert to their natural selves
whenever you give the word.)
^ You can name your new creations and put them in action at a virtual
table. When you do this, you are “loading” them into the “lineup” — your
selected group of players for a game.
Although you can use entirely preprogrammed lineups if you wish, take
advantage of the more open-ended options to mimic players in your
favorite live game. Or create a player profile that plays like you do and
toss it into different lineups to see how it performs.
v0 You can arrange to have players entering and leaving randomly every
couple of rounds, just as they would in a real casino poker game.
To find out how to use the Profile and Lineup options, first read the pertinent
tips. (Clicking the Tips button brings up a handy list.) Click the Help button if
necessary. Digest the comprehensive manual in small doses, and remember
|i
that you can contact Wilson software anytime for more assistance. Don’t be
afraid to experiment!
Running simulations
Simulations are very high-speed tests in which the computer does all the
playing so that you can learn something. If you want to test something con-
cerning your own strategy, you can customize a player profile to mimic your
playing style and load it into the lineup for your test . The computer “sits in”
for you while it plays out the equivalent of a yearlong (or longer) game with
the rest of your chosen lineup, then presents you with the game statistics.
You’ll know how much you won — or lost — to the penny.
212
Part III: Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms
In a “smart” (computerized) simulation — the only kind that won’t give you
misleading results — the computer plays its usual strategic game for each
cyberopponent you’ve loaded. It simply does so at lightning speed. The
resulting statistics summarize what happened under realistic game condi-
tions in which bets, raises, reraises, and checkraises force opponents to
either fold or pay dearly for their mistakes.
The games from Wilson Software do only smart simulations unless you specifi-
cally set up a “dumb” or “shutdown” simulation that simply deals out cards to
see who wins, and then records the results. Dumb simulations produce mis-
leading results, and you really won’t find them helpful in improving your game.
Modern computers handle such tasks in an amazingly small amount of time.
You might be able to grab a soda and check the sports scores while the
computer plays a million hands of whatever situation you’ve set up!That’s
right— a million hands!(You can even run a test for three million or more—
the equivalent of a lifetime of poker— while you watch a football game. Your
computer should have the test results ready for your review by halftime!)

ometimes you simply have to know that you’re playing against, well, real
people — not against computer creations. When the computer oppo-
nents of interactive software games have you talking to yourself and longing
for human adversaries to gripe about, what can you do?
Just as you can find almost anything else on the Internet, you can find poker
games. These cybergames have no physical location, but you can summon
them up from your personal computer at any time. Like genies in a bottle,
they await your command — all it takes is a few clicks of your mouse!
internet Play-Money Games
If you’re not ready for cash stakes, you can play in mock games for play-
money on the Internet. Your opponents may be anywhere in the world. They
won’t be in the same room with you, but they’re real folks looking for a game.
You’ll have to make a few adjustments when you move into online playing.
Internet poker games take place in cyberspace, the universe of electronic con-
nections that is at once everywhere and nowhere. At first it’s a little discon-
certing to hear a disembodied voice ask for your blind, or to have your cards
yanked away by invisible hands instead of folding them yourself!
The Internet game designers have done all they can to simulate the sights
and sounds of a real poker game:
|u* You see yourself represented in pictogram form, seated at a virtual table
|
with other pictogram players, whose real counterparts may be any-
I
where in the world.
2//J
PartIII:Computers,Casinos,and Cardrooms
v0 Your player name or “handle” and the amount you have in play are listed
above or beneath your virtual representative.
Vibrantly colored cards, tables, chips, and player costumes mimic the
visual elements of real casino poker.
u0 An invisible dealer announces bets and raises and declares winning
hands. (However, he doesn’t accept tokes.)
You hear the sounds of cards being shuffled and dealt, and chips clack-
ing when the pot is pushed to the winner.
You “converse” with other players in the “chat window” by typing mes-
sages back and forth on your keyboards.
To check, bet, or raise, you click on-screen choices with your mouse.
Help and hand history are easily summoned by clicking other options.

But it isn't real poker, is it }
Internet play-money poker isn’t real poker, but it’s not supposed to be. Real
poker is played for real money. Even so, you can practice many skills in these
cybergames. For instance, you can brush up on
u0 Evaluating hands
^ Reading hands
v* Folding, betting, calling, raising, and reraising
Categorizing opponents
i0* Figuring pot odds
As in most free (or nearly free) things in life, there are some inherent limita-
tions when you play in online play-money poker games:
00 You won’t be able to watch for tells (the involuntary physical and emo-
tional slips that often give away a player’s hand) unless you’re psychic.
The opportunity to fire in a raise because you’ve seen fear in an oppo-
nent’s eyes is an experience you won’t have in Internet games.
u0 You won’t be able to practice tricky strategies. You’ll probably have to
“show down” a real hand after all the cards are out — forget fancy
moves and bluffs. Players will usually call with anything when no money
is involved.
v0 The games are generally slower than live games and much slower than
interactive software where you play against computer opponents. Many
people play in the games while doing other things, or they may have slow
computers or problems with their Internet service providers (ISPs).
Chapter 14:Internet Poker 213
What the games are (ike
Most Internet play-money games are loose action games. (That’s putting it
mildly!) Players enter pots with guns blazing, firing bets and raises at will.
Much of this activity is just smoke and mirrors, but when the smoke clears,
someone will have made a hand. Don’t expect to win a pot without a struggle!
There are many family pots ( pots in which all players participate in the
action), and you won’t find many wallflowers sitting on the sidelines hand
after hand. Betting is frequently capped (when players put in the maximum
number of raises allowed). Hang on for the ride—
if you have a hand.
You’ll see players call or even call raises with cards they should have folded '
without a moment’s hesitation. You’ll see people calling with a bottom pair,
with backdoor draws, even with as little as one overcard — hoping to get
lucky. After all, it’s fun to play and no fun at all to fold! Your challenge in these
games is to keep from joining the party!
At a good play-money site you will find at least Texas Hold’em and Seven-
Card Stud. Omaha is another popular offering, and if you’re lucky you’ll have
a choice between Omaha High-Only and Omaha/8. The trend is toward a
wider selection of games. You can also find tournaments.
Game menus change with popular trends, and even game sites themselves
come and go. To find out what games are currently available, post an inquiry
at the Internet poker newsgroup r e c. g a m b l i n g , p o k e r ( RGP). (We tell you
all about RGP later in this chapter.)
How) these games help gou to improve
You’ll be playing with people who, like you, are learning the game or have lim-
ited experience. But unlike you, most of them will be playing strictly for fun.
Those folks will be mired in bad habits because they either don’t care or just
don’t know any better, while you’ll be playing seriously in order to improve.
That’s right, seriously! Play as though it’s for keeps, as though your chips in
cyberspace will be cash in your pocket when you win. Oh, you lost? Oops,
there goes your bankroll!Better keep your day job! You can’t refrain from
playing when you get a streak of bad cards? Better get a second job while
you’re at it — you’re going to need it.
Think playing cyberpoker is going to be easy? Maybe for the first 30 or 60
minutes. After that you’ll be fighting the 4F trio: frustration, fatigue, and the
fun factor— the tendency to join in the loose play to have a better time. So
lick temptation now, while there’s no cost.
Part III: Computers, Casinos, and Cardrooms
Make these sessions count. Keep records. Determine when your break point
occurs: How long can you play without yielding to the temptation of playing
inferior hands? Of calling when you shouldn’t? Of getting emotional when a
poor player draws out on you? Remember that the hardest victory in poker is
conquering yourself!
If it’s hard to take an Internet play-money game seriously “when it really
doesn’t count,” remember this: For you, the game really does count. It counts
as preparation, and when you sit in a game with real stakes, you’ll face many
of the same factors you face in these cyberspace games. Here’s why:
1 v0 Unless money is no object, you’ll be playing your first cash games for low
1
limits. In many places, low-limit games are of the loose, “no fold’em” vari-
ety. Even though there’s real money at stake, many players in low-limit
I
casino games will be playing with a devil-may-care attitude. In fact, they’ll
%
be betting and raising as though they’re risking nothing but play-money!
I
If you can keep your discipline even in a play-money game, you are even
more likely to keep your gambling gremlin in check when there’s real
|
money on the table. (What’s a gambling gremlin? Why, it’s that little
voice — and we all have it — that keeps popping up to urge us to stay
when we should fold, or to see one more card when we know the odds
|
don’t justify it.) Keep this in mind: Losing players indulge their gambling
1
gremlin. Winners don’t!
The Best Internet Play-Money Sites:
Internet Poker Casinos
Online poker casinos offering real-cash games often offer introductory play-
money games. These are a great place to start. Here’s why:
J> Because they are meant to get clients used to the graphics and proce-
dures of cash stakes games, these play-money games are user-friendly
by design. You’re a potential cash client, and the online casino hopes to
expand its business by making you feel welcome and comfortable.
Although the games are remarkably easy to use, the programming and
graphics are highly sophisticated — they’re identical to those used in
the money games. Overall, the games are far superior to games offered
at Internet sites intended strictly for entertainment.
Players will be somewhat more serious than those you’ll find at sites
meant strictly for fun. (Notice we say “somewhat more serious.” You’ll
still see seven out of ten players calling the flop. But at least it won’t be
ten out of ten!)
u* You can watch the game of your choice before you play, and then select
your seat to give yourself a positional advantage.

Chapter 14: Internet Poker
If you wish, you can watch the cash games. If the procedure for doing so isn’t
clear, don’t hesitate to ask about it. Ask other players by typing in the chat
window or send an e-mail to the designated helper to get directions.
i
At Internet poker casinos that offer real-money games, you won’t have to pay
to practice in the play-money games. You may have to go through the
motions of setting up an account, though. (Setting up an account doesn’t
mean you have to provide a credit card number, but you will probably have
to give your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number when you
register.)
Getting started
First, you need to download the game site’s program files to your computer.
You then supply a user name or handle by which you’ll be known in the
games. Some people use their first name or initials, or an amalgam of parts of
their first and last names. Others adopt imaginary, literary, or humorous
names — feel free to be creative here.
Once you choose your handle, you may not be able to change it easily, so
choose carefully. (Your handle is the only way opponents will be able to iden-
tify you to remember how you play, so it wouldn’t be fair to keep changing it.)
Finding games
Your ISP may offer play-money poker games. These less-sophisticated games
make fewer demands of your computer. If you have questions or problems,
send an e-mail and ask for help. Most game sites respond promptly to
inquiries.
If you’re already using America Online (AOL) as your ISP, you can play Seven-
Card Stud, Hold’em, Omaha High, and others (including tournament games),
for a small fee per hour. Hours and minutes are meticulously posted to your
account, which is available for your inspection at any time. The total accumu-
lated time is simply billed to you with your regular fee.
AOL has made it easy to find and use the games. To learn about them, use
keyword AOL: HOW TO PLAY GAMES ON AOL. To get to the games, simply
go to keyword POKER.
If you’re not on AOL, your ISP may offer play-money poker games under the
categories Entertainment or Games. If not, or if you don’t like the games, try

Looking for serious play-money games
If you're serious about poker, not afraid of a challenge, and have some quality
time to put in, you might like to participate in IRC Poker. ( IRC stands for
Internet Relay Chat.) IRC Poker is a real-time network poker game community
offering heavy-duty poker games and tournaments played for imaginary
“etherbucks.”
What ’s heavy duty and serious about that? Plenty. IRCers are highly com-
petitive, motivated , and serious about their games. Even expert players
participate — they enjoy the challenge. IRC Poker offers pot-limit and no-limit
games and tournaments, as well as limit tables, giving players on short
bankrolls the opportunity totest their skills in high-limit poker with virtual
dollars. In short, most IRCers can flat out play, so listen up, pilgrim. Playing
here will definitely improve your game, but don’t expect anything about it to
be easy. You won’t get fancy colored graphics, sound effects, or kid-glove
coddling here!
IRC game screens are anything but inviting, and if you tarry too often, you
may find yourself unceremoniously dumped from the game by the IRC poker
police (longstanding dedicated players who get to enforce the rules).
To play, you need to download the necessary programming, which is called
“Greg’s Poker Client,” at h t t p: / / w e b u s e r s . a n e t -s t l . co m / ~g r e g r . Once
you have the program installed and are online, starting the program will auto-
matically take you to I R C . P O K E R . N E T , the game server.
iff
At this point, we’ll leave you to your own ingenuity, but with one parting tip:
Once you’ve dipped one toe in IRC Poker, get your feet wet at the Internet
newsgroup r e c . g a m b l i n g. p o k e r. Post a message at the RGP site to the
effect that you’re new with IRC Poker and need help.
Participating in the Future of Poker at
rec.gamhling.poker (RGP )
Think of the Internet newsgroup r e c . g a m b l i n g . p o k e r ( RGP) as your one-
stop poker newspaper, discussion club, information bureau, and personal
advisor. Like all Internet newsgroups, RGP is a global, interactive electronic
bulletin board serving thousands of people interested in the same subject —
in this case, poker.
As with other bulletin boards, you can read messages already there, respond
to them(using either private e-mail to the author or a public message called
a post that is meant for all RGP readers), or create your own messages.
Chapter 14: Internet Poker 210
RGP is not a chat room; you cannot conduct real-time discussions in news-
groups. Also, expect a slight delay between the time you post a message and
when it actually appears onscreen. (Newsgroup messages are relayed
through a series of servers before reaching the site that appears on your
monitor.)
Finding RGP
RGP is located in the part of the Internet called Usenet News, or Usenet.
Usenet is like a huge electronic bulletin board hanging in cyberspace. It has
thousands of subdivisions called newsgroups.
Newsgroups are organized into categories called hierarchies. You can find
RGP under the category or hierarchy called “rec” (short for recreation), under
subcategory “gambling,” and is devoted to the specific topic “poker.”
As you can see, newsgroups have nothing to do with the daily news. On AOL,
they are found under keyword: Newsgroups. Once there, click on the follow-
ing: Add NewsgroupsOrecCgamblingCpoker. You will have the opportunity
to add rec.gambling.poker to your “Favorites” list, where you store sites that
you return to again and again.
Other ISPs handle newsgroups much the same way. If you don’t find RGP easily
under “Newsgroups” from your ISP’s home page, try typing rec.
gambling.poker into the Internet address window and click on Go. (You don’t
have to put the cumbersome http: / / first when going to a newsgroup.)
Benefiting from RGP
RGP represents the future of poker because it represents the entire poker
community, from experts to rank beginners. As an open forum where one can
exchange ideas, theories, opinions, and personal experiences, it is like a
healthy extended family whose members agree to disagree sometimes. All
members learn from each other’s mistakes and experience.
Regular participation in RGP is the third leg of your comprehensive self-study
course in poker. (The other two are interactive poker software games and
Internet play-money games.) Here are some of the key ways RGP will help you
become a better player:

u* If you give an opinion or propose a theory, you’re likely to get a cheerful
little earful of the opposing view ( just like you would at home). This
causes you to think through your ideas to define them clearly enough to
defend them, and to benefit from counter-arguments and the experience
of other players.
In the course of defending their own viewpoints, in answering questions,
or just as a service to the rest of the group, members will include links
to other Internet poker sites in their posts. (The text of these links,
called hyperlinks, usually appears underlined and in a different color
than the surrounding text. When you rest your mouse pointer over a
hyperlink without clicking on it, the pointer will change into a tiny
hand.) Explore these sites and record or bookmark their addresses.
v* Many game-specific and/or hand-specific situations are described in
detail by players looking for feedback. You can participate in these dis-
cussions or just read any responses posted by experts, who often
respond to the most interesting posts.
Posing an interesting question or theory in a new message may spawn a
lengthy thread (the initial posted message plus its trail of responses). If the
subject is interesting or controversial enough, the thread may go on to weave
a life of its own, generating responses from responses to the point where
everyone from world champions to railbirds chimes in with his or her two
cents. You’ll wonder how in the world your seemingly innocent little post
wound up causing such a fuss!
Such Msuperthreads” are the crown jewels of RGP posts. By following their
strands from message to message, you’ll reap a whirlwind of poker knowl-
edge, insight, and vicarious experience — three factors that translate into
profits when it’s time to cash out your chips at the cage!
Virtual Poker for Real Money: Internet
Cash Stakes Games
Using state-of-the-art computer technology, thousands of people play poker
online for real money. By linking their computers to the Internet, players
living as far apart as New York, London, and Tokyo are able to play together
simultaneously in computer-generated poker games — for real cash.
Until recently, such games weren’t feasible. The challenge was to invent
poker software that would enable strangers to play against each other in live
games from different locations — and with enough confidence to back their
mouse clicks with cash.
Chapter 14:Internet Poker 22/
Without real money at stake, online casinos cannot make profits. (They take
a rake — a fixed percentage of each pot — just as a real casino poker room
does. The only difference is that it’s taken electronically rather than by a
human dealer.)
Milestone advances in computer graphics, sound, and programming made
Internet cash games possible. On January 1, 1998, Planet Poker was the first
Internet poker casino to offer poker for cash stakes. Others followed.
But is it legal?
j
The answer as to whether such games are legal depends on which side of the
business you’re on — supplier side or client side — and also on where
you live.
If you’re thinking of starting an online poker casino, you’d better get out of
Dodge! In the United States, you may be prosecuted for operating such a busi-
ness, since they are likely prohibited by federal law.
Seeing a potential gold rush of almost unlimited'client demand, foreign entre-
preneurs rushed in to fill the void. Internet poker casinos are based in coun-
tries where laws are more lenient, such as Costa Rica.
The clients, however, may live anywhere. In some areas, it is against the law
to place bets on the Internet. Depending on where you live, it may be illegal
to play poker for cash stakes online.
Our advice to you
You’re in a gray area of the law if you place bets on the Internet. Our advice is
to stay abreast of new developments in federal and statelaws by inquiring
about them regularly on rec . gambl i ng . p o k er. Then, let common sense
dictate.
You also need to be concerned about your legal rights— or, rather, your lack
of such — if you play for cash in online casinos.
Consider the following:
1 u* If an overseas-based casino goes bankrupt, you could lose any money
-
you have on account without recourse.

Our advice: Check out an online casino’s reputation with the Internet
I
poker newsgroup rec. gambl i n g. poker. Once you start playing, keep
|
good records and cash out your wins frequently. Leave no more on
1
account than you can afford to lose.

Be alert for collusion. Dishonest players may play in the same game
while using cell phones, instant messages (real time “chat” typed back
and forth from computer keyboards by people who have set up this
capability in advance), or even adjacent computers. In any of these ways,
cheaters may be sharing information unfairly against you.
Our advice: The best online casinos have extensive programming that
monitors and tags unusual betting patterns that indicate collusion.
Choose a well-known online poker casino, and before you sign up, ask
questions about what steps are taken to thwart colluders. Also, if you’re
a beginner lacking the necessary experience to detect unusual betting
patterns yourself , stick to the lowest limits available.(Cheaters usually
play for higher stakes.)
The easiest way to open an account at an online casino is to use a
credit card to make a deposit. You should be concerned any time you
submit credit card numbers and other personal information on the
Internet. Carefully monitor your credit card statements each month.
Our advice: Take the time to check out the poker Internet newsgroup
r e c.g a m b l i n g. p o k e r. Look for threads (groups of messages listed by
subject headings) concerning online poker casinos. After you’ve read
the related threads, start a new one by asking if anyone has had prob-
lems with an account at casino X.
If you’re still not comfortable making a credit card deposit, arrange to wire
the money or send a cashier’s check or money order. Even a personal check
may be acceptable. (When in doubt, ask. Send an e-mail inquiry to the casino
you have in mind.)

Debunking poker myths
^
kayings, myths, and slang abound in poker, conjuring up visions of the Old
^^
West, glittering casinos, or Saturday nights at a buddy’s home — take
your pick!Some sayings contain elements of truth, while others are hogwash.
In this chapter, we define some of those sayings and myths, and poke fun at
others.
Poker Sayings
The colorful quotations you hear in poker can be based on real events or just
made up from long ago. Here is a list of some popular quotations along with
our version of what a person really means when he uses the quote:
Phrase
Translation
“I’d rather be lucky than good.”
Typically said by a player who is neither
lucky nor good. This player often
believes that he should play more hands
than reasonable and that he can get on a
lucky streak by doing so. In the long haul,
when all the luck is bled out of the equa-
tion, it’s skill that separates winning play-
ers from losing players.

“You’ve got to know when to
1
hold’em, know when to fold’ em.”
Typically said by a Kenny Rogers fan or
someone who has no clue as to whether
he should continue playing the hand or
fold.
I
“Sheesh, what a bad beat.”
This refers to when a player loses a hand
where, mathematically, she was a big
favorite. Most players have a bad beat
story.
“If you can’t spot the fish at
the poker table, then it’s you.”
1
J
This refers to the fact that, if you can’t
read players or their abilities very well,
you will probably be the sucker at the
table.
“Hey Joe, bring us a live one.”
Often said by a player at a card club,
asking for a new sucker player to be
brought to the table.
“I’m down a little.”
I’m down a lot.
“Boy, he is a tight player.”
“Read ’em and weep.”
Boy, is he anal-retentive and conservative.
Look at my big hand that beats all of
your puny hands, suckers.
“I was drawing to a double
belly buster.”
This is a draw to two different straights,
such as 3-5-6-7-9. A single belly buster is
drawing to an inside straight.
“Sheesh, things can’t get
any worse.”
Usually said by a poker player who has
gone on a losing streak, and the streak is
about to get worse.
“Trust everyone, but cut
the cards.”
Means trust no one, and cut the cards as
a way to try to prevent cheating.
“Any two will do.”
Refers to the concept that any two cards
in Hold’em can theoretically win the hand.
Used as a justification to play truly
wretched starting cards. However, we all
know that good starting hands are the
key to winning at poker in the long run.

Poker Slang
Some of the colorful terms you hear in poker are intuitive — where the mean-

# Jkay. Where do you go from here? While we sincerely appreciate the fact
\r that you’ve purchased and diligently pored over every word in Poker
For Dummies, it would be presumptuous on our part to believe that this
book alone would allow you to master the game. Determinative mastery of
poker — or most other things, for that matter — isn’t easy to come by, and
while we hope this book gives you a sound foundation, becoming a very good
poker player is not going to happen overnight. You’ll need more tools, along
with a plan, if you want to become a good poker player. But at least you’re on
your way.
The Zen Poker Process
You can learn poker in lots of ways. Until recently, the best — in fact the
only — way to learn poker was to attend the school of hard knocks. Someone
showed you how to play, and then you sat down in a game and lost your
money but hopefully acquired some knowledge in the bargain.
Some folks still learn that way. And while one can learn poker by the seat of
the pants, many players who attend the school of hard knocks still make the
same mistakes today that they’ve made over the course of their lifetime.
While experience might be a good teacher, a substantial amount of poker
theory has appeared in books and other media over the past few decades,
and it’s silly not to take advantage of it.
23^
**art ^°re

p
Learning poker has a Zen-like cachet about it. Imagine laying out all the poker
theory ever developed in front of you like clothes you were planning to pack
for a trip. Even if you could learn all the theory there is to know about poker,
some of that theory would not mean much to you because there’s always an
underpinning of other knowledge required before you can make good use of
each succeeding layer of thought.
That layered knowledge is one reason why learning the basics of poker is so
critical. It provides a basis to understand and place all those juicy tidbits
you’ve just learned in perspective. Knowledge, without a context, is not very
useful. Poker, after all, is neither abstract nor theoretical. To the contrary, it
requires the practical application of knowledge and theory.
/
The application of knowledge within a given context is generally called
“know-how,” and poker is a “know-how” game that’s best learned by going
through cycles of study, play, and reflection — again, and again, and again.
A Learning Plan
While all roads may lead to Rome, some are full of potholes and others
fraught with detours. Do you want to jump-start the learning process? The
best way to become a good poker player in a relatively short period of time is
to follow the plan in this section. It’s a full-immersion process. Study books,
use your computer, play in simulated games, read the magazines and the
Internet discussion groups, play in real games, and think about poker.
While this process will jump-start your learning, please realize that learning
never ends. There’s always something new to learn about this game, and to
keep one jump ahead of your opponents you have to keep learning just as
long as you keep playing. If you’re not learning, you’re falling behind, and
your opponents will eventually pass you. After you master the basics of
poker, it’s the thinnest of lines that separates consistent winners from those
who lose more often than they win. When the gap is narrow, you can’t afford
to give any edge to your opponents and hope to keep winning.
Read beqinnerdeOet books
There’s no point in studying books aimed at advanced players without know-
ing the fundamentals first. You need to get the building blocks in place, and
you made a good start by buying this book. After all, you learned arithmetic
before algebra, and back in elementary school you were reading about Dick
and Jane before you tackled War and Peace.
Chapter 16:Learning More about Poker 233
Read the magazines
The world of poker currently has two magazines devoted exclusively to it.
The first, and oldest, is Card Player Magazine. The new kid on the block is
Poker Digest Both are published in Las Vegas and appear biweekly on alter-
nate Thursdays. Because of this, you are assured of something new to read
about poker once a week.
Because the magazines are distributed in some quantity to those casinos that
advertise in their pages, chances are you can pick up each of these maga-
zines for free if you live in an area that has a casino with a poker room. If
you’re geographically challenged, you can subscribe and keep on top of all
the happenings in the poker world that way.
Use your computer
The computer is a great tool for learning about poker, and we devote a whole
chapter to that electronic wonder. (See Chapter 13.) Not only is there soft-
ware that can help you play better poker by simulating cash games, other
software enable you to practice playing in a tournament environment, too.
You can also play IRC (Internet Relay Chat) poker. Although IRC poker is
played only for bragging rights and not real money, you’ll find the games and
tournaments a great place to improve your game and chat with other players
while you’re at it.
In addition, the Internet newsgroup rec. gambl i ng. poker , or RGP, as it’s
called, provides a forum for poker discussion. RGP is a great place to pick up
tips from some of the top professional players who regularly participate in
that forum.
In addition to RGP, there are other sites dedicated to poker discussion. Two
Plus Two Publishing, which publishes the books of Mason Malmuth, Ray Zee,
and David Sklansky, among others, maintains a moderated discussion group
at www . two pi us two. com. Many players participate in discussions on both
sites; and frequently, a discussion that begins on one forum makes its way to
the other.
Another site you might want to visit is www. conjelco. com . It’s both a
source of information, as well as an online bookstore devoted exclusively to
gaming literature. ConJelCo publishes the works of Lee Jones and Lou
Krieger, sells almost every poker book imaginable, and even offers an online
newsletter to those who request it. This publication, called The Intelligent
Gambler, contains articles by some of the most respected poker theorists in
the world.
236
Part IV:More Poker Fun
Play poker
To learn poker, you have to play it too. That’s the reason behind all the study.
But when you play it’s important to be aware of what you’ve read and what
you’ve experienced in simulated games. You won’t be able to recall all you
read and immediately bring it to bear in a real game. But if you can at least
recall some of the theory you’ve studied and see how it applies under game
conditions, you’re well on your way to becoming a much better player.
Think about the game
>i
When you get away from the table, take some time to think about the game.
And when you think about it, don’t think about the time that someone caught
a miracle card and beat you out of a big pot. Think about how you played.
Think about the things you had some control over. Think about some of the
things you read in books and assess whether you played well or not. Figure
out what you did wrong and make up your mind to rectify it next time.
Not all the elements of a poker game are within your control. Your opponent
can do everything wrong and still get lucky. That happens, and nothing you
can do will put a stop to it. In fact, you should be happy when a poor player
sticks around when he really should have folded and wins with a hand that’s
a real long shot. After all, if he keeps playing that way, the money he won
really isn’t his; it’s just visiting.
Good players beat bad players in the long run, and you shouldn’t lose sight of
that just because you lost a pot you figured to win. You’ll get it all back and
more when you consider all the times a poor player will stick around with
those long shots and not get lucky. It’s never as dramatic, but in the long run,
you’ll come out far the better of it when you are the favorite and your oppo-
nents are the underdogs. Because poker has a large element of short-term
luck associated with it, it doesn’t matter whether any one effort is successful.
What does matter is knowing when a positive expectation is associated with
a given play.
All Kinds of Poker Books
There’s enough recommended reading material in this chapter to give you an
undergraduate degree in poker. Like any recent college graduate, however,
you’ll find the real world to be somewhat different, and education at an
entirely new level begins at the table. Nevertheless, these books will provide
the basics you need.
Chapter 16:Learning More about Poker 237
Moreover, they are books you’ll probably reread many times. Some of the
concepts and strategies in the advanced books are very sophisticated, and
beginning players will not grasp all of their potential implications in one read-
ing. In fact, the more one learns, the more applicable many of these books
become. You’ll find yourself reading and digesting them in a repeating
process of “read, play, and think,” and never stopping because the process of
learning and thinking about poker should never cease.
Books for beginners
Recently there has been an explosion of poker books hitting the market. You
picked this one, and it’s a good start. Many excellent poker books have been
written in the past decade — as well as a few that are really dreadful. Right
now there is enough literature to build an entire poker curriculum, just as if
we were going to construct a college reading list about poker.
Our intention in compiling this list is to not only identify worthwhile books,
but to specify their order of study. To learn how to play well, and to do so
quickly, you need a desire to learn and enough hours at the table to apply
your new-found knowledge under game conditions. If you aspire to becoming
a better player, there’s more you need to read once you’ve thoroughly
digested this book, and the reading list for our poker curriculum follows.
General poker theory
|u* The Theory of Poker, by David Sklansky. Originally published in 1983
under the title Winning Poker, this classic is an absolute requirement for
any player who seeks a thorough grounding in poker theory. Sklansky
discusses poker theory and strategic concepts against a variety of
games and situations. No matter what game you might decide to special-
ize in, this book is one that you will often refer to.
|
Super System — A Course in Power Poker, by Doyle Brunson. This is the
bible of “how-to” poker books, covering most games you’ll ever want to
{
play. It was written by two-time world champion Brunson, along with
selected experts such as Mike Caro, Chip Reese, David Sklansky, and
former world champion Bobby Baldwin. In spite of changes in game
structure that have occurred over the years, Super System is still the
second book in your syllabus.
uI v* Caro’s Book of Tells, by Mike Caro. For a long time this was the only book
available dealing with body language at the table. Now this book has been
supplemented with a two-tape video package called Caro’s Pro Poker Tells.
t
If one picture is worth a thousand words, these videos are worth millions.
I
Sklansky on Poker; by David Sklansky. This incorporates an earlier book
titled Sklansky on Razz into a book full of solid, easily understood poker
theory. Although not a magnus opus like The Theory of Poker, it belongs
on the bookshelf of any serious poker student.
23&
Part IV: More Poker Fun
v* Improve Your Poker, by Bob Ciaffone. Ciaffone, a Card Player Magazine
columnist called “The Coach,” presents sophisticated strategic concepts
in such an easily understood manner that we decided to include this
book in the recommended reading list for beginners. His advice on
deception and bluffing, reading opponents, and tournament play is
excellent, as are the sections on Hold’em, Stud, and Omaha poker.
u* Fundamental Secrets of Poker, by Mike Caro. This book captures the most
important concepts that Caro teaches at his popular poker seminars.
(Caro takes his seminars on the road from time to time, but his home
base is the Mike Caro University of Poker, Gaming, and Life, based at the
Hollywood Park Casino in Inglewood, California.) This book provides
sound advice on Seven-Card Stud and Hold’em, and contains tips on
money management, teHs, psychology, and tournament advice.
i> How To Win at Low Limit Casino Poker, by Shane Smith, includes general
strategies for low-limit play, and specific sections on Texas Hold’em,
Omaha/8, Seven-Card Stud, and low buy-in tournament poker. It is well
researched, well written and a good book for beginning players. Smith is
also the author of Omaha Hi-Lo Poker While Omaha Hi-Lo Poker is full of
sound advice, we recommend that beginners become familiar with Texas
Hold’em before venturing into an Omaha/8 game. But when you’re ready
to learn Omaha, Smith’s book on Omaha should be your primer.
Hotd’em books for beginners
The following books should keep the aspiring Texas Hold’em player busy for
a while:
1 v* Hold’em Excellence: From Beginner to Winner, by Lou Krieger
I
More Hold’em Excellence: A Winner For Life, by Lou Krieger
1
Winning Low Limit Hold’em, by Lee Jones
Actually, there is more than enough information in these three books to turn
any newbie into a competitor who is far more knowledgeable than most begin-
ning players. In fact, there’s enough information in these books to make a win-
ning player out of anyone willing to study and apply the concepts they learn.
Set/en-Card Stud books for beginners
Two books can give beginning stud players a solid grounding in the game:
8 v0 Seven-Card Stud: The Complete Course in Winning at Medium and Lower
|
Limits, by Roy West
I
Seven-Card Stud: The Waiting Game, by George Percy
West’s book is newer, easier to read, and broken down into lessons that make
it easy for any beginner to get a good handle on the game.
Chapter 16:Learning More about Poker ^3^
Books for advanced players
It’s probably not surprising that there are more books written for advanced
players than beginners, even though there are far more beginning players
than those skilled enough to consider themselves a cut above the beginner’s
rung. Poker authors, after all, are not beginning players, and the natural
temptation is to write to one’s own level of expertise rather than to write for
those who are not quite so advanced.
Once you’ve mastered the basics, here are some additional books you’ll prob-
ably want to study to take your own game to the next level.
The "Championship" series
The Championship series of books, written by former World Champion Tom
McEvoy and a man generally regarded as one of the best tournament players
in the world, T. J. Cloutier, comprises the following:
|
Championship Stud
|
Championship Hold’em
f, v* Championship Omaha
1 v* Championship No-Limit and Pot Limit Hold’em
These books contain expert level advice from two highly regarded tourna-
ment professionals. The books are pragmatic and conversational in tone.
Reading them is almost like listening to a tape recording of a conversation
between two top players.
The "For Advanced Players" series
The “For Advanced Players” series of books is written by David Sklansky,
Mason Malmuth, and, on occasion, Ray Zee. The series includes:
| Seven-Card Stud For Advanced Players
n'|
Hold’em Poker For Advanced Players
|v* High-Low Split Poker For Advanced Players (contains sections on
Omaha/8 and Seven-Stud/8)
The For Advanced Players series and the Championship series are very dif-
ferent in tone, but it’s that very difference that makes them complementary.
Sklansky, Malmuth, and Zee lean heavily toward theory that is based on
sound analytical and mathematical underpinnings. The Championship series
is much more conversational in tone, and takes you into the inner thoughts
of professional players in the heat of battle.

Part IV: More Poker Fun
Tournament poker
We recommend two books for tournament players:
| Tournament Poker, by Tom McEvoy, is probably the best book of its kind.
McEvoy won the World Series of Poker in 1983, and has played poker
professionally for more than two decades. This is a 340-page com-
pendium of poker tournament advice, geared for experienced players.
v0 Poker Tournament Tips From the Pros, by Shane Smith, is a good read for
those new to tournament poker or for those seeking to enjoy themselves
in smaller events (where the buy-ins are considerably less than what the
1
big guns play for).
Other recommended books
A number of other books are worth reading, too. Bob Ciaffone’s books,
Omaha Hold'em Poker and Pot-Limit and No-Limit Poker, (the latter co-
authored by Stewart Reuben), contain solid advice for experienced players,
and both belong in the library of any serious player.
David Skiansky’s Getting the Best of It, Mason Malmuth’s Gambling Theory and
Other Topics, along with his Poker Essays, and Poker Essays— Volume II, are
also highly recommended. Another collection of essays is also worth reading
— this one by long-time Card Player columnist and Las Vegas-based profes-
sional poker player Roy Cooke— titled, Real Poker: The Cooke Collection.
If you want to supplement all of this technical material with some books that
give you the flavor of poker, we recommend The Biggest Game In Town, by A.
Alvarez, which is about the World Series of Poker and its participants.
You might also enjoy The Big Deal by Anthony Holden. In this book, Anthony
“London Tony” Holden, the author of two authorized biographies of Prince
Charles, takes a year off to play poker tournaments and cash games in Las
Vegas, London, the Isle of Man, and other exotic locales. Holden’s perception,
wit, and self-deprecating sense of humor make this book a real page-turner.
Beyond the WrittenWord
You need a lot more than book learning to become a successful poker player.
Personal characteristics, integrity, strength of purpose, resiliency, willfulness,
and dedication are all ladled into this stew. As in almost every other human
endeavor, talent is nice to have, but character and the ability to stick with it
count too.

Here are ten keys to success that hold just as true for life itself as they do for
poker.
t o' Know thyself: An outrageous table image works for some people but not
others. Some players are better suited to cash games, others to tourna-
|
ments. Know yourself. Do what you do well.
j o' Be responsible: What you achieve is the product of your own play. If you
can’t hold yourself accountable for the results you achieve, you won’t
succeed.
I v* Think:Do your homework. Keep up with the current literature. Think
about the game at the table and away from it. Analyze and modify your
game. Repeat as needed.
o' Plan: What is your goal as a poker player? Do you want to have fun and
just break even? Do you want to be a top tournament player? Be the best
$15—$30 player in town? If you don’t have a plan of your own, you are
I
most assuredly part of someone else’s!
b
2/J2
Part IV: More Poker Fun
Set deadlines: If your goal is to play 30 hours per week, then do it. If you
want to read the latest poker book, then set a deadline and do that, too.
A plan without a timetable is just so much wishful thinking.
& Be realistic:Set challenging but reachable goals. Keep trying. But don’t
expect to win the World Series of Poker next year if you’ve never before
played no-limit poker.
Expect difficulties: You’ll succumb to all your flaws as a poker player
while you’re learning. Each top-notch player struggled to reach the level
of success he or she has achieved. You’re going to have to do the same.
v* Build on small accomplishments: If you study hard, put what you read
into practice, and integrate sound strategy into your own style of play,
you’ll improve. Success builds upon itself. Ignore small setbacks. If you
play poorly, correct it next time. Focus on achievement. Taking the
worst of it on a hunch, or simply for the fun of it, is nothing more them
premeditated backsliding. Do it and you have only yourself to blame.
J* Persist: You must sustain. Ninety percent of success is just showing up.
Keep playing, practicing, and building on small victories.
Have fun: Enjoy yourself. While there are lots of bitter pills that we all
have to swallow in life, we ought to enjoy what we choose to do. If you
can’t enjoy yourself when you play, you might want to think about other
outlets for your time and money.

«roker is a brilliant blend of strategy and psychology— there is really
V
nothing else like it. When compared with strategy, however, how impor-
tant is psychology in poker? Well, you can beat poker without understanding
psychology, but you can’t beat poker without understanding strategy.
Therefore, it’s important to learn the fundamentals first. But wait! Now we’re
going to say something that — at first — seems to be contradictory:
Psychology can account for the majority of profit you will ever make in poker!
That statement is true because after you master the fundamentals of poker,
you’re most of the way to becoming a good player as far as strategy goes. Sure,
you can improve, but the difference between excellent strategy and perfect
strategy won’t put that much extra cash in your wallet or purse — unless you
happen to be playing against all world-class opponents, which we don’t recom-
mend. What will put extra cash in your wallet or purse is getting inside your
opponents’ heads and making them call you when you have the best hand.
In this chapter, you find out about one extremely powerful aspect of poker
psychology called tells. What’s that? Tells are telltale signs from which you
can determine, for example, whether or not your opponent is bluffing— just
by noting her mannerisms at the moment. Watch your opponent’s body lan-
guage and listen for verbal clues, and you’ll often know with surprising accu-
racy what cards your opponent is holding.
Tells come in two types:
I v0 Those from opponents who are unaware that they are providing the tell
I ^ Those from “actors” who know they are providing the tell and are doing
so in an attempt to deceive you
i

Part V:The Part of Tens
So, first, you need to decide if your opponent is acting. If so, determine what
that opponent is trying to get you to do and then you (usually) do the opposite.
Your opponents act because poker puts them in an unfamiliar arena. They
know that they must act to conceal their hands, but they don’t know how to
go about it. Therefore, most weak and intermediate players just about give
you their money by usually acting the opposite of the true strength of their
hands. When they’re strong, they pretend to be weak; when they’re weak,
they act as if they are strong.
No need for you to go to acting school to find out about revealing cues. Get
into your opponent’s head by taking a look at our list of the top ten tells.
Shaking Hand
Hands that shake is not an act. There’s a homespun theory that goes with
this one. The theory says that if you see someone suddenly start trembling
when making a wager, that’s a signal that this bettor is nervous about the bet
and is probably bluffing.
^ ^
That theory is just plain backwards. If ever a tell were almost 100 percent reli-
able, it’s this one. Few players act in an effort to show nervousness, and gen-
ifcHl
u*ne shaking Is hard to fake. What most likely is happening is this: Your
opponent has made a very strong hand. The hand is, in fact, unbeatable or
almost unbeatable. What you’re seeing is a release of tension following the
suspense of waiting to see what will happen.
Some players are always nervous; they will shake whether or not they’ve
made a big hand. The tell that I’m talking about is sudden shaking. I’m talking
about a player who was previously steady but is just now starting to shake.
This behavior is especially suspicious if the player seems to be trying to con-
trol the shaking, but can’t.
This sudden shaking isn’t a bluff , because players who bluff tend to bolster
themselves. They force themselves to be unnaturally steady, and they hardly
move. They tend to realize instinctively that anything they do might look sus-
picious to an opponent and trigger what we term the calling reflex.
The calling reflex is built into most players who have come to the poker table
for the excitement of seeing a showdown and have a bias toward calling and
against folding. They are looking for any excuses whatsoever to call a bet,
and most bluffers instinctively realize this and do nothing to trigger that call-
ing reflex.So, expect bluffers to be rock steady and seldom animated. Expect
that sudden trembling is not an act, but an involuntary release of energy after
a good hand is made. Unless you have an extremely strong hand, don’t call.
L
Chapter17:Ten Waysto Read Your Opponent 24^
Jittering
Jittering and fidgeting is usually not an act. Players can be impatient.
Sometimes, you’ll see a player drumming fingers rhythmically on the table.
Now, he bets. The drumming of fingers continues. You reach toward your
chips. The drumming stops!
What does this mean? It usually means the bettor is weak or bluffing and
doesn’t want the call. A player who really has a big hand will usually continue
to be relaxed in the face of a pending call. When we have a close decision
about calling or folding, we often use the technique of seeming to reach
toward our chips to see what a jitterer’s reaction will be. Whether it’s drum-,
ming of fingers or fidgeting beneath the table, if that action stops abruptly,
we call, believing the likelihood of a bluff is high. If it doesn’t stop, we fold.
Shrugs and Sad Voices
*\HG!
Shrugs and sad voices are acts. Whenever a player shrugs, sighs, and says, “1
bet” in an exasperated tone of voice, you need a big hand to call. This player
is going way out of his way to convey sadness.
So, let us ask you a question: Why is he doing that? If he really had a weak
hand or was bluffing, would he go out of his way to let you know it? Of course
not! He’s acting sad because he hopes that will make you think his hand is
weak. But, remember, weak really means strong when they’re acting. Shrugs
and sad voices are key indications of strong hands.
Changes in Breathing
A change in breathing patterns is not an act. This unconscious tell is one of
the strongest in poker. If you’re seated near the opponent, you often will be
able to hear this tell. But even if you’re seated across the table, you some-
times can see it by the movements of the person’s diaphragm.
The key here is that players who make strong hands tend to become excited
and need to breathe faster. Players who are bluffing, on the other hand, tend
to disguise their breathing and sometimes stop entirely. They fear that any-
thing they do might trigger their opponent’s calling reflex, so they become
extremely unanimated and scarcely breathe.

Part V:The Part olTens
Misdirected Bets
A misdirected bet is an act. If the action is three-way or more, expect your
opponent to be most concerned about the player who appears to be the most
threatening. If you seem to have the strongest hand, based on exposed cards
and previous action, then you should be the main target.
What if an opponent, instead, stares down another player who doesn’t seem
to be the big threat? And what if the opponent then aims his bet toward that
other player? What then? Then you have witnessed a misdirected bet and
you have every right to think, “Hey, what about me?”
^ ^
This misdirected bet usually means that the player is trying to convince you
that he isn’t really worried about your hand but about something he sees
IlOl ®
elsewhere that is even more powerful. But if you can’t see that other threat,
then you should usually conclude that the misdirected bet was all an act. You
should not be intimidated into folding. In fact, if your decision would other-
wise have been between calling and raising, you might lean toward raising.
Extra Emphasis
Extra emphasis on a betting motion is an act. This is one of the hardest of all
tells to spot, and you need to train yourself to see it. We’re not talking about
conspicuously exaggerated bets. Those bets can be either a lure to entice
your call, or a false warning not to call, depending on the opponent and the
situation. What we’re talking about is more subtle.
Watch the tail end of a bet. If the betting motion is smooth but is closed by a
slight extra flare— perhaps a flick of the fingers releasing the chips— that’s
extra emphasis and it usually indicates weakness. The opponent is either
bluffing or uncomfortable about the strength of his hand. The final flare hap-
pened because the player thought at the last instant that he wasn’t making
the bet seem strong enough. Why would he worry about that? Only if the
hand was not powerful enough to make the bet comfortable.
So, when you see extra emphasis on the tail end of a bet, tend to call more
often than usual.
Looking Au>ay
Conspicuously looking away from the action is usually an act. A player look-
ing away from you tends to be more dangerous than a player looking at you.
Chapter 17:Ten Ways to Read Your Opponent 23/
When you see a player gazing away from the action as if distracted, beware.
There are only two possibilities here, folks. Either that player really isn’t
interested — so why risk a bet?— or the player is acting to deceive you. If
the player is acting, then she’s trying to make your bet comfortable. Don’t be
fooled. Unless you have a very strong hand, check and fold after the oppo-
nent bets. If you bet a medium-strong or worse hand, expect to be raised.
And almost never bluff into a player who is gazing away from you.
Staring at\lou
When it’s your turn to act, an opponent conspicuously staring in your direc-'
tion is likely acting. This usually is a dare, an attempt to prevent your bet
through intimidation. The opponent may call but will almost never raise. This
means that you can bet any medium-strong hand with impunity, not fearing a
raise.
So, instead of being intimidated by an opponent staring you down, simply
consider that you can make more borderline bets for profit when you hold
marginally strong hands.
Reactions after Looking at Their Cards
When opponents look at their cards, they are usually not acting at this point,
because they don’t think they’re being scrutinized. Unless you’ll slow up the
game, it’s silly to look at your cards while your opponents are looking at
theirs. Your cards will still be there later, and if you look at them now, you’ll
miss out on some of the most valuable tells in poker.
See if your opponents quickly glance toward their chips after seeing their
next cards. This tell usually means they liked what they saw and are planning
to bet. This is especially true if they glance at their chips and then stare con-
spicuously away as if uninterested. This last part — staring away — is what
they do think you’ll see after you get done looking at your cards. Remember,
players staring away usually have strong hands.
i5
On the other hand, your opponent may not bother to stare away. It’s the
quick glance at the chips here that you’ll miss if you’re not watching. This is
an especially powerful tell in Hold’em on the flop. Watch your opponents
watch the flop. You don’t need to see it yourself just yet. It won’t go away.
Also, watch when your opponents first peek at their starting hands. The
longer they look, the more likely it is that the hands are weak and they’re pre-
tending to show interest. Conversely, if the opponent looks and recognizes a
big hand, he will usually cover it quickly and then pretend to show no inter-
est in pursuing the pot.
2
Part V: The Part of Tens
Reaching for Chips
Reaching for chips in anticipation of another person’s bet is often an act.
While weak players and beginners who hold strong hands may sometimes
reach for their chips before it’s their turn to act, more experienced players
don’t do this.
If you’re thinking about betting a borderline hand, see if your opponent
reaches for chips as you make a motion toward your stack. If so, there’s a
good chance that this was a deliberate act designed to prevent your bet. This
means you can comfortably bet many borderline hands that would have been
too risky had you not known that your opponent didn’t want you to bet.
A Final Word
Here’s one additional tip about learning to spot tells: Don’t get frustrated.
Most tells aren’t 100 percent accurate. You need to use tells to add weight to
the final decisions, just as you might take the exposed cards into considera-
tion. Tells are just another factor to consider along with the strategic action
that led up to the current decision — a very powerful factor, but just one
factor.
Finally, don’t concentrate on too many players at one time. We recommend
that you focus on just a single opponent until you become comfortable read-
ing tells. Trying to see everything can be so overwhelming that you end up
seeing nothing

Jtroker is the only popular game of skillful human interaction where it’s
V
possible on any given day to play against the world’s best players. At
any of the hundreds of major poker tournaments held in the United States or
Europe every year, you could find yourself face-to-face against former world
champions such as Scotty Nguyen, Phil Hellmuth, Jr., or Huck Seed. Ever
heard of them? How about T. A. Preston? Name sound familiar? He’s better
known as “Amarillo Slim.” If No-Limit Texas Hold’em is your game, you might
get raised by none other than Johnny Chan, who appeared in the film,
Rounders. Chan won two World Series of Poker titles back to back!
If you visit Las Vegas, you could go head-up against Doyle Brunson, also
known as “Texas Dolly.” Brunson has been called the “Babe Ruth of poker” —
a fitting moniker among poker players that does as much for the late
Bambino’s image as Brunson’s. He’s a living legend and a two-time world
champion. Just walk into casinos in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlantic City,
London, and places in between, and you’ll see players who have electrified
the game and thrilled millions of viewers on ESPN, the Discovery Channel,
and in several championship poker videos.
Part V: The Part of Tens
What distinguishes a poker “legend” from other poker players who may be
successful in their own right? Conferring legendary status means the player
has reached a certain level of accomplishment in the poker world manifested
in the universal respect of one’s peers. Poker legends are widely respected
because they usually win (or have won) the most money in years past. They
also usually win (or have won) the biggest tournaments in their careers.
Their play is feared and respected. They have a powerful public image, even
a celebrity-like status in poker circles when they walk into a cardroom and sit
down in a game. That’s a poker legend.
In this chapter, we identify ten legendary poker professionals. It’s possible
you will encounter some of these names during your poker career, particu-
larly the younger superstars who are now dominating tournament competi-
tion. At the very least, you will hear these names spoken around poker
tables, so it’s certainly wise to give yourself some background about poker s
rich history and discover what makes these players truly special.
Stu Ungar
In the late 1970s, Stuey “the Kid” Ungar burst onto the Las Vegas poker scene
with the full force of a firestorm. When it came to conventional poker strat-
egy, Ungar didn’t just push the envelope, he ripped it to shreds. Poker hasn’t
been the same since. From an early age growing up in New York City, Ungar
was a savant at the card table. Before becoming a successful poker player,
Ungar set the gin rummy world ablaze. His talent was so overwhelming that
by the time Ungar was a teenager, he could no longer find opponents willing
to play for money. So, at age 24 Ungar moved to Las Vegas and immediately
jumped into the biggest poker games he could find.
Ungar won the World Series of Poker and the Super Bowl of Poker three times
each. (No other player has won both events even once.) But the genius that
made him also destroyed him. Ungar’s lifestyle was as flamboyant as his rol-
licking character at the table, his eccentricities amplified by astronomical
wins and devastating losses. As brilliant as he was at the poker table, Ungar
was burdened with personal problems that were largely of his own making.
This ultimately resulted in his tragic death in 1998, at age 45.
Most memorable quote: “I just want to destroy people at the poker table.”
Johnny Moss
Johnny Moss was called “The Grand Old Man” for good reason. He played
poker almost daily his entire life, all the way until his 89th birthday. Originally
from Texas, Moss played on the famous underground circuit in illegal gambling
Chapter 18:Ten Poker Legends 233
halls and backrooms of the South during the Great Depression and eventually
became respected as one of the best traveling pros in the world. Moss was
the first to launch the concept of poker as a spectator event, participating in
perhaps the greatest heads-up poker match of all-time, the 1949 duel on
Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas when he faced Nick “the Greek”
Dandalos in a 21-week marathon of Five-Card Stud.
Moss later moved to Las Vegas and took over the Dunes poker room, which
for many years was the mecca for high-stakes poker. Moss won the World
Series of Poker three times (the only player other than Stu Ungar with as
many victories). Had the World Series been initiated earlier — before Moss’s
advanced age — there’s no telling how many more world championships he
would have won. He passed away in 1997.
/
Most memorable quote: “If things get tough, you get tougher.”
Jack"Treetop" Straus
Everyone called Jack Straus “Treetop” because he stood six-feet seven-inches
tall and had a big bushy beard. He was a truly lovable man, a larger-than-life
figure with a reputation for gambling every single dollar in his pocket on a
daily basis. Straus carried around bundles of money, which often amounted
to thousands of dollars, stuffed haphazardly into a brown paper bag. On
more than one occasion, Straus lost the bag and was left flat broke. He usu-
ally dismissed these losses with a casual comment, “Such is life.” Straus was
a truly great No-Limit Texas Hold’em player, certainly one of the best of his
day. He won poker’s world championship in 1982. For many years, the
Frontier Casino in Las Vegas held a major tournament in his name, which
attracted poker’s top players. He died of a heart attack in 1988 while in Los
Angeles, fittingly while sitting in a high-stakes poker game. No doubt, Straus
died with a smile on his face, doing what he loved best — playing poker.
Most memorable quote: “I have only a limited amount of time on this earth,
and I want to live every second of it.”
Benny Binion
One of Las Vegas’s last true patriarchs, Benny Binion started out by running
illegal bootlegging and gambling rackets in Dallas during the 1930s. Binion
arrived in Las Vegas in 1946 (some insist to evade murder charges back in
Texas) and bought the dilapidated Eldorado Casino. He renamed it Binion’s
Horseshoe, and it soon became the epicenter of gambling activity. The
Horseshoe wasn’t really built for common tourists; it was a place for real
gamblers.
J
250
Part V: The Part of Tens
For more than four decades, Binion had a standing public offer: He would
accept a wager of any size, from anyone who walked into his casino. More
than a few eccentrics were entranced by Binion’s willingness to take the ulti-
mate gamble, and there are many stories in Binion’s folklore (all true) of high-
rollers with suitcases full of money riding on a single roll at the craps table.
But Binion’s first love was poker.
In 1970, Binion decided to try and duplicate the success of the Johnny Moss-
Nick Dandalos match some 20 years earlier. He invited all of the top poker
players to the Horseshoe for what he deemed would be the world champi-
onship. The World Series of Poker was born. Now, over 30 years later, the
annual event at Binion’s Horseshoe remains the preeminent poker event in
the world and every serious poker player’s dream. Binion died in 1989. The
Binion family continues to dperate the casino.
Most memorable quote: “Treat people right, and the rest will take care of
itself.”
“Amaritto Stim" Preston
Probably the best-known poker player in the world, Amarillo Slim’s down-home
style and natural charm have made him a household name. Thomas Austin
Preston was, in fact, born in Arkansas and took his memorable appellation
many years later when he bought a ranch in West Texas with his gambling
winnings. In his younger days, Slim made most of his money not at the poker
table, but as a pool hustler. During a stint in the navy, Slim won over $100,000
in cash (and five cars, according to one story) while traveling up and down the
West Coast.
Slim’s exposure to gambling introduced him to other legendary players of his
day, including Doyle Brunson, Brian “Sailor” Roberts, and Johnny Moss. Slim
won the World Series of Poker in 1972 and continued to be a dominant force
in the poker world for a long time. Aside from his poker prowess, perhaps
Slim’s true genius has been marketing himself with colorful yarns and home-
spun quips that have entertained millions of viewers and turned new genera-
tions on to the excitement of poker.
Slim has appeared on The Tonight Show over a dozen times in addition to his
numerous other television and radio appearances. Slim also organized what
was for many years poker’s second-largest tournament, the Super Bowl of
Poker. Today, Slim lives in his namesake Amarillo and can be found at many
of poker’s biggest tournaments.
Chapter 18: Ten Poker Legends 257
Doyle Brunson
“Texas Dolly” was born in the dusty West Texas town of Longworth in 1933.
He earned a full basketball scholarship to Hardin-Simmons University and
was scouted by the (former) Minneapolis Lakers. Just before the NBA draft,
Brunson shattered his knee and the history of poker (and perhaps basketball,
too) changed forever. Brunson, who went on and earned a degree in educa-
tion, toured gambling’s underground circuit in the South like many of his
poker contemporaries — winning hundreds of thousands of dollars while
dodging the law and getting robbed at least a dozen times.
Brunson won back-to-back world poker championships in 1976 and 1977. He
also finished second in 1980. Brunson has won a total of six World Series of
*
Poker events, including his most recent victory in 1998 in the Seven-Card
Stud Razz event. (Razz is a version of Seven-Card Stud in which the lowest-
ranked hand wins.)
In 1999, Brunson defied the odds again by making the final table at the inau-
gural Tournament of Champions, besting nearly 500 other poker players.
Brunson is equally respected for his many contributions to poker’s develop-
ment. He wrote the book acclaimed by many as the “bible” of poker: How I
Won A Million Dollars Playing Poker, (also known as Super/System: A Course in
Power Poker) first published in 1978. He also wrote a popular column,
According to Doyle, which ran in Gambling Times magazine for more than a
decade. Today, Brunson lives in Las Vegas and still plays almost every day in
the biggest games at the Bellagio.
Johnny Chan
Known as “the Oriental Express,” Chan arrived in the United States from
China when he was 9 years old. His parents, fleeing the horrors of the
Cultural Revolution, set up a restaurant in Houston. At 21, Chan came to Las
Vegas where he worked as a Glitter Gulch fry cook on Fremont Street. He fre-
quently played poker after his shift was over, sometimes still wearing his
white apron while sitting at the table. Chan eventually made enough money
to quit his minimum wage job and became a full-time poker player.
He rotated between the biggest games in Las Vegas and Houston for a decade
before winning his first world championship in 1987. The following year, Chan
won the title again. In 1989, Chan was shooting for his third consecutive
world championship, which would have been an unprecedented feat.
However, he finished second to a young first-timer named Phil Hellmuth, Jr.
Since then, Chan primarily plays only in the biggest games, although he made
an appearance in the 1998 poker movie, Rounders, starring actor Matt Damon.
258
Part V: The Part of Tens
Phil Hellmuth, Jr.
The self-described “poker brat” is one of poker’s most intriguing, yet contro-
versial players. At times, he demonstrates a level of ingenuity that is rare,
even among high-stakes poker players. On other occasions, Hellmuth admit-
tedly plays so poorly he probably couldn’t beat a small-stakes game.
Originally from Madison, Wisconsin, Hellmuth is the son of a university dean.
He started playing poker seriously while enrolled at the University of
Wisconsin and soon discovered he was far more interested in playing poker
than studying.
At age 24, Hellmuth played in his first World Series of Poker. He shocked the
poker world by upsetting two-time defending champion Johnny Chan and
became the youngest winner in the history of Binion’s annual classic.
Hellmuth is famous for terrorizing the poker circuit with devastating hot
streaks. In 1991, he finished in the top five in all Hall of Fame events at the
Horseshoe. Two years later, he won an unprecedented three World Series of
Poker events, in the same year! He also won the Hall of Fame championship
in 1995.
Incredibly, all of Hellmuth’s big wins have been in Texas Hold’em events,
although he normally plays all games. Today, Hellmuth lives in the San
Francisco Bay area. He continues to play high-stakes poker and can be seen
at most major tournaments.
Scotty Nquyen
The tale of Thuan “Scotty” Nguyen is truly a rags to riches story. Nguyen
( pronounced “win”) fled South Vietnam in 1979 on a small boat that was
stranded in the South Pacific. He was picked up with his family by a U.S.
naval vessel and brought to the United States. Nguyen arrived virtually penni-
less and eventually settled down in Chicago.
At age 21, Nguyen moved to Las Vegas and began working as a poker dealer.
In his spare time, Nguyen started playing for low stakes and entered small,
daily tournaments that were common in Las Vegas (and remain so). Over the
next decade, Nguyen’s skills gradually improved and he quit dealing to play
poker full-time. Nguyen’s first big break came when he won the Omaha High-
Low Split event at the 1997 World Series of Poker, He returned the following
year at age 35, and won poker’s world championship, defeating a then-record
350 opponents.
Chapter 18:Ten Poker Legends
Chris Moneymaker
Chris Moneymaker — yes that’s his real name — turned the poker world
upside down and on its ear by winning the 2003 World Series of Poker. Poker
had a different look in 2003, and “Money” as his friends know Chris, is
emblematic of it all.
2003 was the year Internet poker took hold, and many of the crowds that
swelled the fields for the World Series of Poker events won their way in by
playing online. That ’s how Moneymaker did it. He entered a $40 buy-in satel-
lite event on pokerstars,,com,a leading online poker site, won his event, and
with it an entry into poker’s big kahuna. Moneymaker’s win isn’t only symbolic
of Internet poker’s coming of age, but also it means that anyone can become a
top-notch poker player in the comfort of his or her own living room.
Moneymaker can play poker with the best of them. His victory in a grueling
event lasting five days proved that. But he’s no grizzled Vegas pro; in fact the
World Series of Poker marked the first poker tournament he ever played in a
brick-and-mortar casino.
As past champions, big-money pros, and other players were eliminated over
the tournament’s five-day run, two players were finally left standing:
Moneymaker and Sammy Farha of Houston. With his friends cheering “Go
Money,” he won the event with a full house consisting of three fives and two
fours. Farha had a jack and a 10, ending up with a pair of jacks.
Moneymaker’s win helps revolutionize poker and boost the game’s popular-
ity. “1 got lucky along the way. 1 bluffed a lot during the tournament , but some-
how 1 got away with it,” said Moneymaker, who only began playing poker
three years ago.
Back in the real world, far from Las Vegas’s glitz and glamour, Moneymaker is
an unassuming 27-year-old accountant from Tennessee who was working two
jobs to support his wife and three-month old daughter when he won poker’s
premier event and a first prize of $2.5 million. When he burst in from the com-
plete anonymity of Internet play to win poker’s most prestigious event, he
really tore down the walls. For his efforts, he no longer has to work two jobs,
and his young daughter now has her college tuition paid for — and, oh yes,
he’s no longer anonymous.
Moneymaker, who donated $25,000 of his winnings to cancer research, said,
“I was a little underestimated because no one knew who I was. If I can win it,
anybody can.”

ookstores are filled with self-help books. Seminars galore promise to
teach you how to bea winner in business, in love, and in your personal
life.Some of these same principles can make you a winner at the poker table..
Here are ten you may want to think about.
:
Be AuJare of\lour Strengths and
Weaknesses
An outrageous image at the table may work for some people but not for
others. Some players are better suited to tournaments, others to ring games
(cardrooms). Play your best game and play within the confines of your own
comfort zone. In other words, know yourself , and do what you do well.
Act Responsibly
What you achieve in poker will be the product of your own play. Yes, luck is a
factor in the game, at least in the short run. Over the long haul, it generally
evens out. But until you acknowledge your own accountability for the results
you achieve, you won’t be able to exercise enough control over your skills
and abilities to ensure success.
Think
Don’t just play poker — you have to think about it. Unless you’re consistent
about doing your poker homework, you’ll simply find yourself marking time.
You need to keep up with the current poker literature, and you need to think
about the game. Think about it while you’re at the table and when you’re away
from it. Analyze hands you’ve seen. Decide whether you would have played
them differently — and if so, why? Learning about poker, like learning about
most other things, is a recursive process. Think, analyze, and modify your
game. Then, repeat as needed.
202
Part V:The Part of Tens
HaVe a Plan
What is your goal as a poker player? Do you want to have fun and just break
even? Do you want to be a top tournament player? Or do you want to be the
best $15—$30 player around? How much are you willing to risk? You need a
definite plan for your poker play. Without a plan to guide you, you’re likely to
wind up as a pawn in someone else’s game!
Set deadlines
J
If your goal is to play an average of 30 hours per week, then do it. If you plan
to reread Poker For Dummies until you know it cold, then set a deadline for
yourself and do that too. If you’ve lost all your poker money and need to
rebuild your bankroll before venturing back into a casino, plan on how long it
will take untii you are back in action. Once you have a plan, go out and get
the money you need to enable you to start playing again.
Be Realistic
If your goal is to win the World Series of Poker next year but you’ve never
played a big limit game in your life, don’t expect to achieve that simply by
virtue of having read this book. Let’s get real here. While your authors are
terrific teachers (who are now learning to walk on water) they haven’t quite
mastered it yet.
Instead of indulging your fantasies, start with a challenging but reachable
goal. Once you make it, you can set the next, more difficult, goal. Perhaps you
want to set a goal of playing in one or two inexpensive tournaments per
week, or playing in satellites that are usually part of the format surrounding
major tournaments. If you don’t do well there, keep trying. But save your
money. You’re probably not ready yet to invest big bucks in entry fees to
major events.
Expect difficulties
You will succumb to all of your flaws as a poker player during the period you
are struggling, growing, and reaching for a higher level of skill. Just because
you’ve read all the books by all the experts, don’t deceive yourself into
believing that you’re going to play as well as they do. Every top-notch player
Chapter 19:Ten Keys to Success 203
struggled to reach the level of success they’ve achieved. You’re going to have
to do the same. Golf videos won’t turn you into Tiger Woods, chess mono-
graphs won’t turn you into Gary Kasparov, and Poker For Dummies will not
turn you into Doyle Brunson. The best poker books will teach you how to talk
the talk. You’ll have to walk the walk on your own!
Build on Smalt Accomplishments
If you’re not a winning player today but you study hard, put into practice
what you read, and integrate these strategies into your own style of play,
you’ll find yourself improving. You may not be able to make your living from
the game, but at least you’ll no longer be a contributor. Keep doing what
works for you, and you’ll find that success builds upon itself.
Don’t let small setbacks put you on tilt. You’ve already taught yourself to
expect difficulties. If you play poorly, correct it next time. However, if you find
yourself saying, “Just this once won’t hurt me,” you’re wrong. It can hurt you,
and it will. You’ve got to focus on what produces accomplishments. Playing a
weak hand or taking the worst of it on a hunch — or just for the fun of it — is
nothing more than premeditated backsliding. Do it, and you have only your-
self to blame.
Persist
You must sustain. The saying, “Ninety percent of success is just showing up”
has a lot of truth to it. You need to keep playing, keep practicing, and keep
building on small successes. Each time you reach one of your goals, savor the
moment. Then quickly set another goal.
Try visualizing. Golfers visualize their putts dropping; baseball players visual-
ize the bat connecting with the ball; basketball players visualize the hoop
growing and the ball dropping through, hitting nothing but net. In your mind,
watch yourself make the right plays at the poker table. When you’re able to
visualize strategies in action, you’ll see your winnings accrue in the process.
Keep showing up, play your best game, and keep moving forward. Remember
that some of your opponents will be improving too. If you do not consistently
move forward with your own game, you are probably moving backwards in
relation to your opponents.

Have Fun
2bL
Enjoy yourself while you are playing. Time spent playing poker is discre-
tionary. No one has a gun at your head. If poker is not enjoyable, don’t play.
While there are lots of bitter pills we all have to swallow in life, we ought to
enjoy what we choose to do. If you cannot enjoy yourself when you play, per-
haps you should find another outlet for your time and money.
Some players are constantly griping when they play. Some of them have done
this for years. It seems they are never happy. Why do they bother to play
when they get no enjoyment from it? Questions like that can take a lifetime to
answer. But unhappy players generally represent profit to you. So have fun
when you play, or find something more enjoyable to do. You won’t succeed af
a poker player if you have to fight yourself as well as your opponents.
The information in this chapter is simple stuff, and it’s as true in life as in
poker. Look inward, look outward, set goals, deal with the inevitable setbacks,
show up, have fun, and succeed. Sometimes it’s that easy.

(Almost)TenThingsto Consider
Before Going Pro
m o most recreational poker players the idea of playing professionally seems
m like a dream. Get up when you want to, work when and where you choose,
and ply your trade almost anywhere. From London to Las Vegas and California
to Costa Rica, casino poker awaits you there.So what’s stopping you? Only the
answer to this critical question, “Can 1 make a living as a poker player?”
Poker Isn't Like Most Jobs
For one thing, if you’re a poker player, you won’t have a steady salary coming
in. Even commissioned salespeople don’t lose money if they fail to make a
sale. But poker players do lose money whenever they have a bad day. It’s one
of the few jobs where you can go to work and lose money. Imagine that. An
entire day of poker— under stressful conditions— and all you’ve got to show
for it is less money than you started out with. Not a pretty picture, is it?
Still, people take up poker as a profession every day. Some do so after years
of deliberation. A few do it on a whim. Others pursue it as a second career —
after retirement — when they have alternative sources of income to steady
the ship in a storm. How successful are they? There are no statistics handy—
but we’d be willing to venture a guess that the majority of newly hatched pro-
fessional poker players go broke, and probably do so within a year.
So how do you know if you can make a living playing poker? For a relatively
unstable profession, there seem to be quite a few indices available to the sea-
soned player who’s thinking about earning his living at the tables. Here are a
few we’d recommend:
200
Part V:The Part of Tens
Considering your OvOn Results
Anyone seriously considering poker as a career needs to keep his or her
poker diary up-to-date, and do it assiduously. Never mind that you were tired,
just had a fight at home, were stuck in horrible traffic on the way to the
casino, and didn’t play your best. When you’re playing for a living, no
excuses are allowed. Only reality counts, and wouldda, shouldda, couldda
doesn’t mean a thing.
Ringing When you're Mot at your Best
Part of being a professional player is how well you play when you’re not at
your best — and you won’t be at your best all the time. But professional
poker players need to play their best game every time they walk into a
casino. If you don’t feel you can, you shouldn’t play. Remember that playing
poker frees you from a time clock. You don’t have to play. And if you’re not up
to par, it will cost you far less to go see a movie than it will to visit the tables.
Keeping Good Records
If you haven’t been keeping good records, you are not ready to play profes-
sionally. Oh, you can give it a go. No one’s going to stop you. But without a
foundation in data of your results, you might be deceiving yourself about
your ability, and that can cost you more than money. If you have a career, a
family, or other responsibilities, then going broke playing poker will take its
toll on them all. If you don’t believe us, just look around. Casinos are littered
with broken souls.
Bedding Where to Flag
Let’s look at the bright side. Suppose you have been keeping good records,
and furthermore, you’re a winning player. What should you do now? That’s
easy. You need to decide where you want to play for a living. Perhaps you are
living in an area where there are only small limit games— too small to pro-
vide the kind of livelihood you want — and you decide to move to California,
or Las Vegas, or Atlantic City, or even Europe for that matter. Before you
make the leap, do yourself a favor. Take the time to go there for at least a
month to six weeks.
Chapter 20: (Almost) Ten Things to Consider Before Going Pro
There might be a big difference between the games where you’d like todive
and those in your own backyard. And if you’re moving up to bigger limits
because you can’t earn enough money in small limit games, you can be
assured of this; As you move up the ladder, the players get better. Part of
becoming a professional poker player is finding your rung on the ladder. It’s a
question of striking a balance between the betting limits, which have a major
impact on how much money you can earn, and the quality of your opponents,
which will have a huge impact on how much you will earn.
Smaller games are more easily beaten, but lower betting limits constrain the
amount of money you can expect to win. Big limit games usually have
tougher players in the lineup. But if you are good enough, there’s a limit you
can beat that offers the best balance between your theoretical earning power
and your actual win rate. When you’ve found that limit, you’ve arrived. That’s
not to say you can’t move up. But that’s where you belong now.
Using Statistics to Predict your
Expectations
If you think you can beat the games you intend to play in for a living but
aren’t certain, you can use statistics to help you assess what you might
expect to win over the long haul. This involves calculating your standard
deviation (see Chapter 9) and using it to assess the kind of results you might
achieve.
Let’s say that after 900 hours of playing $20-$40 Hold’em, your standard devi-
ation is 20 small bets per hour, which is equivalent to $400. Everyone’s stan-
dard deviation is different. Yours will depend on a number of factors,
including your playing style, your opponents’, and how aggressive or passive
the game is.
Once you become familiar with the concept of standard deviation, you’ll
begin to see it as a useful tool for qualifying and describing your hourly win-
ning average. You’ll also realize that poker strategy frequently involves walk-
ing a fine line between playing aggressively so as to maximize your win rate,
and not taking unnecessary risks in order to minimize the variance or swings
you experience.
Assessing your Risk Tolerance
The answers to so many “How should I play this hand?” questions really
depend on your own risk tolerance. And you’re free to choose your playing
style; there’s no right or wrong answer. You might be comfortable adopting a
208
Part V: The Part of Tens
playing style designed to yield the highest possible win rate — and along
with it, a much higher variance. Or you could win just as much money by
playing cautiously, but you’d have to put in more hours at the table to
achieve it.
If this seems like an anomaly, it’s not. It’s also the reason why very aggres-
sive, top-notch players— those who take advantage of every edge, no matter
how slight, in order to maximize their win rate— run a greater risk of going
broke than work-a-day, grind-it-out professionals.
No Licensing Required
No credentials are required to be a professional poker player. No licensing or
certification is needed. Anyone can do it. You can jump in if you dare, and
who knows, you might succeed beyond your wildest dreams. But if you’d
rather take a calculated risk before you give it a go, our advice is to be
scrupulous about your recordkeeping and track your standard deviation to
provide some perspective on your win rate. And give yourself a fair tryout in
your venue of choice beforescorching the earth behind you.
Fottou/ing Good Examples
Playing poker for a living can be a solitary and sometimes lonely experience,
and it helps to build relationships you can trust and to find other successful
players who can serve as role models. Look at players whose results you
admire and try to find out what they do and how they do it. See if you can
learn the secrets of their discipline. Find out how they resist the temptation
to play marginal hands in bad positions. Learn how they keep from going on
tilt, and discover how they exploit the table when they have the best of it.
You’ll find plenty of people you can talk to in any cardroom, but few you can
absolutely trust to speak openly, honestly, and truthfully with you. When you
find these people, keep those friendships. You can discuss your play and
problems with them. You will each improve as a result of reinforcing one
another. But you have to be willing to give more than you get in any relation-
ship, and cardroom relationships are no exceptions.
Chapter 20: (Almost) Ten Things to Consider Before Going Pro
Asking the Right Questions
Some players persist in asking the wrong questions. If you persist in asking,
Why can’t 1 win? Why do I always get the bad beats? Why does the idiot in
seat five always win with aces and 1 always lose with them? You’re asking the
wrong questions too. Questions like these are self-defeating because they are
based on the paradigm that life at the poker table is beyond your control.
If you change that paradigm to acknowledge that you are responsible for
your actions at the card table, you might ask instead: How can 1 keep apply-
ing the winning strategies I’ve learned? What can 1 do to continue to prepare
to win? How can 1 increase my winnings by recognizing and eliminating the
“leaks” in my game?
If you ask the right questions your mind will direct itself to positive sugges-
,
tions. Once you tell your mind that you do exercise control over your
actions, it will suggest strategies based on this assertion. Successful people,
and that includes successful poker players, do this routinely.
There’s an old cliche that says, “Poker is a hard way to make easy money.”
And it’s true. To be a successful professional poker player you need skill, dis-
cipline, strength of character, and the willingness to persevere when every-
thing seems to be going against you and the light at the end of that proverbial
tunnel seems to be receding like the view from the back end of a telescope.
But if you have the right stuff you can overcome this. Professional poker can
be fun, rewarding, and social; and not many jobs let you set your own hours.
You can even promote yourself to bigger games whenever you think you’re
ready for the challenge.

Playing poker for a living is not easy. But if you’re realistic about assessing
your chances, you might just be able to pull it off.

Ten Waysto Improve Your
Poker Today
#1° You want to become a better poker player today? Right now? Here are
^^
ten specific things you can do today, and each one of them will improve
your game.
Knout\lour Numbers
If you don’t learn, understand, and use poker’s mathematical parameters, it
will prove difficult to be a consistent winner in the long run. For example, if
you’re playing Hold’em and flop four cards to a flush but don’t know the odds
against completing that hand, what will you do when it’s your turn to act?
How will you ever know whether calling, raising, or folding is a play with a
positive expectation? Finding positive expectations is the essence of winning
poker, and it’s no more complex than recognizing those situations that will
show a profit if they could be replayed time and again.
Knowing when a positive expectation is associated with a given play is a big
part of winning. Imagine you’re faced with a $20 call into a $100 pot, but the
odds against making your hand are only 3-to-l. That’s a positive expectation.
Repeated 100 times, you’d expect to lose $20 on 75 of those occasions, for a
loss of $1,500, but on 25 occasions, you’ll win $100, for a total of $2,500. Your
net win of $1,000 ($2,500-$l ,500) is what’s important — not whether you won
or lost on any particular hand. Divide your $1,000 win by the 100 times this
situation occurred, and you’ll see that in the long run, each correct decision
was worth $10 to you.
Applying mathematics, statistics, and probability to poker can be an incredi-
bly involving subject. But if you want to find out more about poker mathemat-
ics, read Hold’em’s Odds Book, by Mike Petriv; Getting the Best of It, by David
Sklansky; or Gambling Theory and Other Topics, by Mason Malmuth.

\\
How many times have you made a strategic move that’s doomed to fail
because you chose the wrong opponent? Ever tried to bluff against someone
who’s a veritable calling station? It won’t work. We all know that, but far too
often we do it in spite of our better judgment.
If mathematics was the only skill required for winning, the best players would
all be mathematicians— and they’re not. Knowing your opponents is equally
important. Observe their actions at the table. Analyze their decisions and the
choices they make. Are they in every hand? Do they raise with hands that
don’t warrant it? Are they rock-tight? You’ll find it fairly easy to get a read on
most players within an hour. The best time to do this is when you’re not in a
hand. If you find yourself waiting for a game, watch your opponents-to-be, so
you can adjust and temper your game strategies to their play before you sit
down at the table.
Keep Hour Ego Out of the Game
\H6/
s'
Never, never let your ego control your play. Like they said in The Godfather,
“This is business, not personal.” Never personalize it if an opponent wins a
big pot from you, not even if he looks you right in the eye and laughs like a
loon as he rakes in the chips. The minute you decide to “ . . . get him,” you’re
sure to miss other opportunities and probably squander some chips chasing
him down. If the old adage, “Living well is the best revenge” holds true, then
playing well— and walking away with a few racks of chips— is a giant step in
that direction.
Keep Records— EOen When It Hurts
If you don’t keep records how will you know whether you’re winning or losing
in the long run? Players who fail to keep records deceive themselves. Most
players, when asked, will say they’re life-long winners. But we both know
that’s not true. The next time someone tells you he’s a life-long winner, ask
about his records. If he doesn’t assiduously record wins and losses, he’s
seeing only what he wants to— and more often than not, it’s an illusion.
While few things are more painful than recording a big loss in your notebook,
records are critical because the human mind is blessed with an endless
capacity for self-deception.
Chapter 21:Ten Ways to Improve Your Poker Today 273
Choose the Best Game
Much as we’d like to believe otherwise, the truth is that most of our winnings
come not from our own brilliance but from our opponents’ poor play. Choose
the game with the weakest opponents. A game full of weak players who call
too often but are reluctant to raise with strong hands will do fine. After all, if
you can’t beat players who call too much, who can you beat?
Commit to Excelfence
j
Want to be a great poker player? Commit to greatness. Declare your excellence
tonight, starting with the next hand you play. Visualize yourself as the greatest
poker player ever — and act accordingly. You can reach excellence in a heart-
beat, and you can do it today. If you want to be a winning, excellent player, go
ahead and commit to it. Achieving change takes no time at all, but it will take
forever to maintain it. Committing to excellence is that simple, but it requires
every bit of your willpower.
Practice With ComputerizedSoftware
No matter how many hands you play at the table, using software like Wilson
Software’s Turbo Texas Hold’em to practice against lifelike opponents and run
simulations that will test your own theories will help you make rapid
progress in your development as a poker player.
Computers can do things humans don’t have the time to accomplish. We’ve
run experiments that simulated a lifetime of poker. We could have tested that
same hypothesis by playing eight hours a day, five days a week, for 30 years,
but what could we accomplish with that knowledge once we finished our
research? It might be helpful if poker is played in the afterlife, but we’re more
concerned with earthly uses for our know-how.
Read the Newsgroup
If you don’t have a computer, now is the time to go out and buy one. When
you get that box home, connect to the Internet and read the discussions and
poker news on the Internet newsgroup, r e c . g a m b l i n g . p o k e r (RGP). While
you’ll find lots of social chatter, the Internet is often the source of some
incredibly creative ideas about poker.
27^
Part V: The Part of Tens
These ideas, for the most part, are not circulated outside the newsgroup. Its
not out of secrecy, mind you, it’s just that RGP attracts very bright, creative,
and insightful folks who enjoy talking poker. As a result, it’s fertile ground for
new ideas and concepts. Ideas are posted, and comments swiftly feed back to
the author. Information at warp speed:that’s what the Internet is all about.
You can follow the growth and development of ideas as they are molded and
shaped by some of the poker community’s brightest thinkers and theorists.
The Internet is a medium you cannot ignore if you are serious about keeping
up with the game’s most ourrent thinking and concepts.
Analyze four Game — and four
Opponents'
Think when you’re at the table, away from the table, and whenever you’re not
involved in a hand. Watch your opponents. Remember what kinds of hands
they are willing to enter pots with in early, middle, and late position. See if
they call too often or whether they are susceptible to bluffing. Learn their
proclivities and patterns, and plan your strategy accordingly. You won’t be
very successful bluffing someone who calls all the time, and you only hurt
yourself if you fail to bet for value against someone who calls far to often with
weak hands.
Think about your own play too. Review hands you’ve won and lost. Determine
whether there were alternative plays that would have resulted in a bigger win.
or saved a bet or two if you lost. The line between winning or losing can be a
fine one, and concentration may make all the difference between winning and
losing in the long run.
Concentrate on Things That Matter
If you pay attention to the wrong things, the very best you can hope for is to
get lucky. Asking for a deck change won’t help you win. It won’t cause you to
lose either, but why concentrate on something that is of absolutely no value
at all?
Poker tables are full of bad beat stories, and it won’t take long until you’ve
heard all of them. Why waste time grousing about the fact that your oppo-
nent got lucky? We all take turns getting lucky. That’s not the point. Instead,
think about what you might have done to knock him out of the pot so he
wouldn’t have had a chance to draw out on you. That matters!
Chapter 21:Ten Ways to Improve Your Poker Today 275
Focus on how you played, and think about what you might have done differ-
ently to influence the outcome. Thinking about luck, or a deck change, or a
dealer who’s always bad news for you is unproductive. It’s just like howling at
the moon. It may feel good to do it, but ultimately it’s silly and self-indulgent,
and it won’t help you win.
Face it. Nothing will make you an expert overnight. But there are a number of
shortcuts along the road to poker excellence. Some of them, like computers,
software, and books, require investments. But you will lose much more than
you would ever invest in your own skill-building and development if you fail to
invest in these tools. If poker matters to you— if you really want to become a
winning player — then ypu owe it to yourself to take the steps that matter.
Read Aft the Books
We hear players eschew books all the time at the poker table. “I’ve played 20
years,” they grumble, “and I don’t need books to teach me about the game.”
Yet it’s these very players who think a deck change is going to improve their
luck, or that a certain dealer has it in for them. Sheeesh!These guys have
been making the same mistakes for years, and their know-nothing attitude
ensures that they will repeat this unproductive, mindless behavior for the
next two decades.
There are lots of good poker books out there and we suggest you read them
all. If you get just one good idea from a book, it will return the cost of its
purchase many times over. Poker books are not an expense, they are an
investment — one that’s absolutely critical for improving your game. Check

Ten Real-Life Poker Lessons

t
ms there a player out there who hasn’t observed that poker is a metaphor
^
for life? That metaphor is probably one reason why poker is so popular.
Not only does it frequently mirror life, poker models it. Poker is life in a nut-
shell. The entirety of our existence compressed into a single hand of poker is
a compelling thought.
A metaphor and a model for life! If true, there should be important life lessons
everyone can take away from the poker table. When learned and applied,
these lessons should make it much easier for a poker player to survive in a
world where most people haven’t been force-fed these life-lessons across the
poker table.
Being Selective and Aggressive
In the real world you do have to pick your battles, just as you must in poker.
Sometimes you have to draw your proverbial line in the sand (“You’ve gotta
know when to hold ’em”); other times you have to carefully choose when to
retreat (“Know when to fold ’em”).
History is replete with examples. General Robert E. Lee, confronting over-
whelming supremacy in men, munitions, and technology, was able to keep
the Confederacy’s cause alive as long as he did because he picked his battles
carefully. He did not engage the Union Army at every opportunity; he
selected opportunities only when he believed he could negate the Union’s
inherent advantages and overcome them.
Safetg at Alt Costs Can Be Costfg
During the early stages of the U.S. Civil War, Union General George McClellan
was unwilling to commit his troops, even when the odds were strongly in his
favor. McClellan behaved like a player who is overly weak and overly tight,
and General Lee consistently ran him off the best hand. McClellan ultimately
27S
Part V:The Part of Tens
suffered the military equivalent of a really bad beat. President Lincoln, who
realized that his man held most of the big cards — and wondered why he
wouldn’t play a hand and therefore couldn’t win — sacked him!
You can’t wait for a royal flush in cards or in life. When you have an over-
whelming advantage, it’s usually time to engage your opponent.
Knowing\lour Opponent
If you can pick up tells in a poker game — where players take great pains not
to broadcast them — think hbw easy reading people away from the table can
be. Yet seemingly few of us really take the time to know our opponents. Is
your boss in a nasty, irritable mood? Maybe you’d be better off feigning an
emergency and postponing your annual performance review until next week.
You have a bad hand, and rather than risk losing even more money, the smart
move is to fold and wait for a better opportunity.
There’s undoubtedly something romantic about the fatalistic approach of
marching into the jaws of death or some more civilized equivalent, but it’s
not a strategy that will help you win at either poker or life. But you needn’t
take our word for it. General George Patton said much the same thing in his
celebrated quote, “The idea of war is not to die for your country; it’s to make
the other guy die for his.”
Timing Can Be Everything
Is that boss of yours still in a foul mood? Wouldn’t you stand a better chance
of winning if you held a stronger hand? Tackle a tough project now. Close that
sale and make some customer so happy that he calls your boss and tells him
how valuable you are. Once you’ve been able to accomplish that, you’re hold-
ing strong cards — strong enough to stand up to your annual performance
review.
This situation is like so many that occur in poker. Someone bets, another
player raises, and you throw your marginal hand away, preferring to wait for
a much stronger hand before engaging your opponent.
Timing is important in your social life too. You don’t have to be an expert on
body language to realize that you’re not making a great impression on your
date, who has legs crossed, arms folded, and is leaning away from you with a
bored, indifferent facial expression. It’s time to try a new strategy, or be selec-
tive, fold your hand, and wait for some new cards to be dealt.
Chapter 22:Ten Real-Life Poker Lessons 27 y
Deciding If the Prize Is Worth the Game
Winning poker players usually won’t draw to a flush when the odds against
making it are 3-to-l or more, but the pot promises a payoff of only two dollars
for each dollar invested. They’ll wait until the pot promises a bigger payoff
before risking their money.
The analogy is also true away from the table. While real-life payoffs can vary
widely, your investments are usually time, money, or both. Is it worth your
time to spend half a day trying to make a small sale without the promise of
greater rewards down the road, or are you better off courting one of your
bigger, better customer^?
J
Whenever you analyze situations like this, the answers often seem obvious.
Still, many people fritter away large amounts of time, not realizing that they
are being horribly unproductive in the process. Office workers spend hours
dealing with problems and issues that may be urgent, but are often neither
significant nor important.
Better time management frees you from dealing with issues that have small
payoffs associated with them. If you aspire to success, you’ll look for chances
to capitalize on opportunity, rather than spend your.time fighting small,
insignificant brush fires.
Reaching for Objectives
If you have no standards to guide you in selecting the hands you choose to
play and adopt an any-two-cards-can-win philosophy, it probably won’t be
long until you lose all your poker money Knowing in advance which cards
you’re going to play, what position you’ll play them from, and how you’ll
handle different opponents are key factors to success at the poker table. The
real world is no different. If you don’t plan, you’re just a leaf in the wind.
While traveling in a random direction does get you somewhere, it’s probably
not where you hoped to go.
Poker teaches you to plan, to have an agenda, and to pursue it aggressively
In the real world, if you don’t have your own agenda, you’ll soon be part of
someone else’s. In fact, it’s probably safe to assume that if you examined
every person foolish enough to join a cult, you’d find very few of them with a
plan or a set of governing values to guide them.
2SO
Part V:The Part of Tens
Being Responsible
Everyone, it seems, has a favorite bad beatstory. It won’t take long until you’ve
heard them all and grow weary of them. Whenever someone launches a
misery-laden tale in the direction of poker author Lee Jones, he announces that
he charges a $1 fee to listen to each bad beat story.Some people are so bent on
sharing their woeful tales that they toss him a chip and go right on talking.
No one wants to hear you whine at the poker table. So you lost in a way that
defied all imaginable logic and odds. Enough, already. It doesn’t change any-
thing. You’ll never be a successful poker player until you accept full and com-
plete responsibility for the results you achieve.
*
Real life is much the same. Success in any field demands a willingness to be
held accountable for your actions. Don’t expect sympathy because you
weren’t born with Rockefeller’s money, Einstein’s brains, or Tom Cruise’s
looks. Neither were most folks. Get up. Get on your feet. Play the cards you
were dealt — in poker and in life— and go on from there. Like successful
poker players, those who are successful in real life are willing to place the
blame for their failures right where it belongs— squarely on their shoulders.

When Lou Krieger was 12 years old, his archenemy was Zimp, an overgrown,
overweight 13-year-old. Zimp was always threatening to beat the daylights
out of Krieger, who had no doubt he could do it. But Krieger had an out. Zimp
was big and strong, but he was slow. Since Krieger could outrun him, outride
him on a bicycle, and outclimb him over garage roofs and trees, he easily
escaped every time Zimp took a run at him. As long as he was never cornered
in a blind alley, he knew he could survive childhood.
Skinny Vinny didn’t care for Krieger any more than Zimp did. Krieger could
take Vinny, although Vinny was faster. Had Vinny and Zimp been card players,
they would have known that even though Krieger was a favorite against each
of them individually (he could outfight Vinny and outrun Zimp) if they ever
teamed up, he was dead meat. All it would have taken was for Vinny to run
Krieger down and keep him engaged until the ponderous but powerful Zimp
arrived. But neither Zimp nor Vinny were fledgling rocket scientists; they
weren’t friends anyway, and never got together to conspire about how to take
out their mutual enemy.
Next time you’re holding a pair of kings or aces and thinking about just call-
ing instead of raising to limit the field, remember Zimp and Vinny. They never
got the better of Krieger because each chose to face him individually — and

Krieger was a big favorite heads up. If they took him on together, Krieger
would have gone from a favorite individually to an underdog against their col-
lective efforts.
In the early 1970s, George Foreman was not the cute, funny, larger-than-life,
genial grandfather he appears today. Back then many experts considered him
the most punishing force boxing had ever seen.
On his road to a fight with Muhammad Ali, Foreman destroyed Ken Norton ,
and Smokin’ Joe Frazier — two fighters who gave Ali a very tough time.
Foreman was so strong and his punching power so punishing that he literally
walked through the best his opponents could offer and annihilated them with
his stinging jab and devastating right hand. Foreman hit Joe Frazier so hard
with a right hand to the body that Smokin’ Joe was lifted about four inches
off the ground. When he landed, Ali’s toughest opponent collapsed like a sack
of potatoes in the center of the ring.
That was enough for Ali, who realized that if Norton and Frazier couldn’t
stand up to Foreman, neither could he. He needed a new strategy, and to
devise one he hand to think outside the box.
When the Rumble in the Jungle, as the fight was called, finally got under way
in Zaire, it began as the pundits predicted. Big George Foreman was relent-
less, throwing punch after punch at full force in the direction of Ali, who cov-
ered up while leaning back against the ropes.
Ali offered little resistance. Outside of a few seemingly futile jabs, he looked
as if he wasn’t even trying to fight back.
But that was Ali’s strategy. After a few rounds, the heavily muscled Foreman
grew tired. He had punched himself out and was spent. Ali, by comparison,
was fresh. He was also unhurt. Ali then began a counterattack. He came off
the ropes and danced in the center of the ring. Ali, who was faster, peppered
Foreman with jabs and stinging overhand right hands. Now it was Foreman
who had nothing to offer. “What’s the matter, George,” Ali said as Foreman
launched a slow, tepid punch in his direction, “Is that all you got?”
“Yeah,” Foreman recalled saying to himself as he related the tale years later,
“that’s all I had.”
Ali, who — like any good poker player — was selective and very aggressive
once he had the best of it, won the fight. Like many good poker players, he
also managed to get inside his opponent’s head by dint of his guile, style, and

image. But ultimately it was Muhammad Ali’s creativity and ability to think
outside the box that allowed him to beat George Foreman in a fight only he
thought he could win.
Realizing When discretion Is the Better
Part of Valor
Sometimes life’s lessons don’t have to be transported from the card table and
applied elsewhere; they are learned right on the spot. At Hollywood Park
Casino players can bet on th'e horse races without leaving the card table. Bet
runners take the bets and return with pari-mutuel tickets.
One of the players in a $20-$40 Hold’em game was particularly animated
whenever it was race time. He would get up from the table yelling and shriek-
ing at the top of his lungs as each race was run.
Whenever his horse won he would laud it over the table. “I win, 1 win, I win,"
he would shout, “and all the rest of you are losers.”
Whenever he lost he would yell even louder, often directing his remarks to
different players at the table. Once, when he had a particularly large wager
on a horse that finished out of the money by a nose, he noticed a player at
the other end of the table who was smiling at him. “What are you looking at,
loser,” he screamed. Til kill you.”
The player just sank further down in his seat, as if to avoid any confrontation
with the manic horseplayer. This only encouraged the horseplayer’s aggressive
tendencies. “Are you laughing at me?” heshouted. “No one laughs at me. I’ll rip
your head off,” the horseplayer continued, as he stood up next to his seat.
“1 don’t think so,” the player at the other end of the table said softly, as he
stood up, still smiling.
As soon as his adversary stood up, the horseplayer quickly realized the error
of his ways. The player he was threatening to kill was a former professional
football player (an All-Pro lineman, to be exact) who had spent 13 years in
the NFL. The horseplayer was of average height and weight. The former foot-
ball player was about 8 inches taller and 120 pounds heavier.
The former football player smiled at the horseplayer and said, “Just sit down ,
shut up, and start over. Only this time, be nice.”
Just to show you how rapidly some of life’s lessons are learned, the suddenly
conciliatory horseplayer sat back down immediately. This time he was the
one who seemed to slide all the way down in his chair. And all he said was,
“Yes, sir.”
