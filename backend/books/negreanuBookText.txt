Kid Poker 
Daniel Negreanu, one of the most popular and charismatic 
players in poker, exudes the confidence of a new generation of 
poker players raised on video games, the Internet and MTV 
Best known for both his aggressive style of play and his amiable 
personality, Daniel was the leading money-winner in the first 
few years of the World Poker Tour (WPT). And until the 
recent dramatic surge in World Series of Poker (WSOP) prize 
money, he was the all-time money winner in poker tournament 
history. As of this printing, Daniel's tournament winnings are a 
staggering $8 million—and growing. 
Negreanu's 
accomplishments 
include 
three 
WSOP 
bracelets, 
two 
WPT 
championships, 
Player-of-the-Year 
awards in both the WPT and WSOP, more than 40 wins in 
tournaments worldwide, and international stardom as one of 
the best tournament players in the world. 
Negreanu is an esteemed contributor to Doyle Brunson's 
Super System 2, the author of a nationally syndicated newspaper 
column entitled "Playing Poker with Daniel Negreanu," and a 
consultant to fullcontactpoker.com, a site he launched in 2003. 
He appears regularly on TV playing poker against the best 
players in the world. 
Acknowledgments 
Poker has been very, very good to me, and I feel compelled 
to thank those that share the same spirit for the game that I 
have. 
First and foremost, I'd like to thank Steve Miller of Card 
Shark Media for encouraging me to write these pieces and 
for helping me reach millions of readers across the USA and 
Canada. Also, thanks to Avery Cardoza of Cardoza Publishing 
for making this book happen, and to Tom Mills for his great 
editing. 
From a more personal standpoint, I definitely want to 
thank my mother, Annie Negreanu, for being the best mother 
a son could ask for. Also, I thank my father, Constantin, who 
passed in 1996. I only wish he was around today to see what 
poker has become and to see that his boy did alright. 
To Jennifer Harman, not only the best female poker player 
in the world, but also a truly great friend, I say thank you. 
Jennifer has taught me so much about poker, most importantly 
how to be a professional poker player. 
Also, thanks to the "Rat Pack," consisting of Phil Ivey, 
7 
John Juanda and Allen Cunningham for sharing so much of 
their knowledge with me and helping me become the player I 
am today. 
I'm also thankful to all the wonderful friends I've made over 
the years playing on the poker circuit. The poker community is 
such a close-knit group and I feel fortunate to be a part of it. 
I hope you enjoy reading the book as much as I've enjoyed 
writing it.

Introduction 
You're holding a book that can really enhance your poker 
game. I've compiled fifty of my favorite strategy nuggets and 
thoughts written specifically about today's most popular poker 
game, Texas hold'em. 
Each piece is concise and contains valuable information 
that will help you at all levels of the game. It's not intended 
to be a heavy-handed poker encyclopedia, but a fun primer 
and reference guide that can be read and re-read to help keep 
important game concepts fresh in your mind. 
I'm actually a poker fan first, and a player second. The 
tremendous growth that poker has seen in recent years—due 
to fans enjoying the game on television and playing on the 
Internet—has brought poker into the mainstream. The image 
of poker as a seedy game, played in dingy environments, is 
fading fast. Some even call it a sport now—a sport of the 
mind. 
I've really enjoyed writing this book because it's allowed 
me to give something back to the game that I love so much.

Top Ten Rookie Mistakes 
Here is my list of the top ten mistakes rookie players make 
at the poker table. If you see yourself represented here, it's time 
to make some changes to your game. 
1. Bluffing too much. 
Most rookies have watched too many Hollywood movies 
and have convinced themselves that poker is all about bluffing. 
Somehow, they think that if they just keep betting, everyone 
will get out of their way. That's unlikely, because a habitual 
bluffer is easily identified by his opponents early on. 
2. Lack of patience. 
Playing poker means you'll go through long stretches of 
sheer boredom waiting for good cards. Rookies often don't 
have the patience to wait for quality cards, so, out of boredom, 
they start playing hands they know they shouldn't. 
Don't lose your patience, find it. 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
7. Elevated ego. 
No, you're not as good as you think you are. In fact, you 
have a lot to learn. The day you realize you know too little 
about poker is the day you actually might start learning a thing 
or two. 
Know-it-alls generally know very little about what it takes 
to improve their poker game. It's very important to be objective 
about your skills and where you might need improvement. 
8. Playing too many hands. 
Rookies play more 
hands 
than 
they 
should, 
not 
understanding the importance of starting with premium hands 
in premium situations. Pick up a book or two before sitting 
down to play, and you'll understand why 9-3 is a bad hand to 
start with, whether it's suited or not! 
With all of the information out there today, there is no 
excuse for lacking fundamental poker knowledge. 
9. Playing on tilt. 
Just like a pinball machine that gets banged too hard, a 
beginner will often short circuit when he loses a couple of bad 
hands in a row. A tilted player loses all faith in his game plan 
and will chase bad hands like inside straight draws, even though 
he knows he shouldn't. 
And now, drum roll please—the number one mistake 
rookie poker players make. 
10. Playing too many hours. 
Your brain just doesn't function well after spending very 
long stretches sitting at the table. Rather than getting some 
rest, and coming back fresh the next day, most beginners end 
up playing too many hours trying to chase their money back. 
In the process, they end up throwing away even more. 
Your mind plays tricks on you after so many hours, and 
17

you'll often convince yourself that you're playing well. Chances 
are, you're not.

Top 5 Reasons Why You're Losing at Poker 
There's a quote I once heard that I thought was genius: 
"Poker is a lot like sex. Everybody thinks they are great at it, but 
most people don't really know what they're doing." 
Because of that truth, people generally blame their losing 
streaks on bad luck. Well, while bad luck can certainly play a 
role, there might just be other pressing factors for your losing. 
Here are the top five reasons. 
1. Bad luck. 
If this is your worst problem, then, ironically, you're in 
luck! Why? Poker is a game where luck does play a part in how 
well you do, and bad luck could be the reason you're losing. 
However, the longer you play poker, smartly, the less likely 
bad luck will continue as a factor that brings you down. Like all 
poker players, you have to ride out bad luck streaks. Just don't 
be foolish and create your own bad luck. 
Losing a few sessions in a row can easily be chalked up 
to bad luck, but if you're habitually losing after months and 
months of play, chances are bad luck is not the key factor. 
19 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
Here's a suggestion: Chart your results by the hour. See how 
you're doing after 500 to 1,000 hours of play before throwing 
in the towel. If you're still showing a loss after that much play, 
well, you just might have a problem that has nothing to do with 
luck. 
2. Too predictable. 
This is especially true if you were once a winning player 
against the same opponents and are now losing to them on 
a regular basis. If you have a very straightforward approach 
to the game, it could be that your opponents are on to you. 
Solution: Elevate your game by adding some deceptive plays 
to your arsenal. 
For example, if your opponents have caught on to the fact 
that you simply never bluff, maybe it's time that you come out 
of your shell and start making some creative moves. 
3. Playing in tough games. 
You could be the fifth best poker player in the world, but if 
you're seated at a table with the top four players in the world, 
well, you're the sucker! 
Game selection is as important to your bankroll as how 
you play the game. Swallow your pride, put your ego in check, 
and simply ask yourself this tough question: Are the guys that I 
play with better than me? If the answer is yes, you need to find 
a new game against lesser-skilled competitors. 
4. Lack of fundamentals. 
This is a common reason for losing. But there is some good 
news: Learning poker fundamentals is as easy as picking up 
a few great books and working on expanding your knowledge 
base. Hey, it certainly couldn't hurt. 
If you don't have a solid foundation for making poker 
decisions, you'll always be a step behind. Learn how to play 
20 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
the game the right way by focusing on the basics, and when you 
get those down, add your own style to the mix. 
5. Playing on tilt. 
The most significant factor in your overall results is how 
you handle yourself when you get unlucky. Many players blow 
a gasket, lose their cool, and their bankrolls soon follow. 
Taking a bad beat or two is inevitable. The difference 
between long-term winners and losers is how bad luck affects 
their play over the course of the session. 
You never want to chase your money. You also don't want 
to lose your patience by playing hands you know you shouldn't 
be playing. If you simply can't handle the stress related to bad 
beats, then do yourself a favor and quit before things turn 
ugly. 
Remember, there's always tomorrow. Poker isn't going 
anywhere. 
21 
Table Talk 
There are two opposing views on the effectiveness of table 
talk as a poker tactic. 
Chatting at the poker table can give you an opportunity to 
learn about your opponent's hand, but the risk is that you might 
actually give away too much information about your own. 
Well, if you've seen me play poker on TV, you know how 
I feel. I'm convinced that when used properly, in the right 
circumstances and against the right opponent, table talk can 
help you gain enough information about another player's hand 
that it's worth the risk. 
The juggling act that you face is trying not to spill the beans 
by divulging too much information about your own hand. 
Here are my seven rules for successful table talk that you 
might want to follow. 
1. Avoid table talk if you are a beginner. 
If you are just learning the game, don't get caught 
up in psychological warfare with players who are more 
experienced than you are. Instead, focus on the fundamentals 
22 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
like understanding the strength of your hand and what your 
opponents have, before tackling the art of table talk. 
2. Avoid talking to great players. 
If you are up against an expert, chances are he'll be able to 
read through whatever you're saying and figure you out before 
you get any information about him. 
3. Do your talking on your own time. 
If an opponent is studying you, you'd be better off sitting 
still and staring at on one spot on the table. Unless you feel 
like you can manipulate your opponent into doing exactly what 
you want him to do, stay quiet. 
Now, if you are studying your opponent and he is willing to 
have a conversation, try this: Ask him some inane question like, 
"What are winters like in Phoenix?" The way he answers may 
give you just the clue you need to figure him out. 
4. Mix it up. 
Okay, I know that lying is sinful, but all is forgiven at the 
poker table. If people start to peg you as a player who always 
tells the truth, or always lies about your hand, then all your 
chatter will do is guide your opponent in the right direction. 
If you want to be a table-talker, you'll need to learn to lie 
with the same tone, mannerisms, and speed as you would if 
you were comfortably telling the truth. If that's not something 
you are able to do, then I suggest you keep your mouth shut. 
5. Avoid patterns. 
I cannot tell you how many chatterboxes I know that clam 
up like scaredy cats when they are bluffing. They continue 
to yap away when they have the nuts, but when they are in 
jeopardy they suddenly come down with a case of laryngitis. 
Don't be that player. If you can't hold a normal conversation 
23 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
when you're bluffing, don't table talk. You'll risk giving your 
opponents way too much information about your hand. 
6. Have fun and relax. 
If you're relaxed when you're talking to your opponent, 
you increase the chances of him being the same. And when he's 
relaxed, chances are he'll be less conscious of what information 
he is giving away. 
Let him just go through the motions unaware, enjoying 
your witty conversation, while you drain information from his 
reactions. It's cruel, I know, but so effective. 
7. Manipulate the weak. 
That doesn't sound very nice, but hey, we're talking poker 
here! The weak players are the ones that you should generally 
look to exploit with table talk. 
Say, for example, you have the nuts and want your opponent 
to call but notice that he is about to throw his hand away. Say 
or do something, anything, to make him reconsider. Before he 
lets go of his cards, try something like, "Phew! For a second 
there it looked like you were going to call me." 
Whatever works, right? 
There's one last thing to keep in mind. At all times, avoid 
being rude, vulgar or mean in any way. It's simply unnecessary 
behavior. 
Contrary to popular belief, being a jerk at the poker table 
does not help your bottom line. People are generally a lot looser 
with their money when they're having fun. Make people mad, 
and all that will do is make them harder to beat. 
Bottom line: Tell jokes, not insults. 
24 
Three Levels of Poker 
There are three basic levels of thought when it comes to 
approaching a poker hand. As your understanding of poker 
evolves, and your skills improve, you'll reach Levels Four, Five, 
Six, and so on, but each stage, after the first three, basically 
repeats. 
1. The first thing you need to focus on is, "What do I 
have?" 
That's about as simple as it gets, and that's why it's called 
Level One. 
As a beginning player, you need to be able to look at your 
cards, look at the board cards, and then figure out what you 
have and what cards you need. Then, you must factor in the 
probability of one of your needed cards actually coming. 
2. The second thing you need to think about is, "What 
do my opponents have?" 
That's pretty basic as well, and called Level Two. 
25 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
Once you've figured out what you have, and whether or 
not it's a good hand, Level Two requires you to consider what 
your opponents may or may not be holding. 
You accomplish this by focusing on their betting patterns, 
both past and present. Any information you have on your 
rivals' previous betting history will help you with the current 
situation. Other things to ponder, even before you get to their 
betting patterns, include the following: what cards they like 
to play, how they usually play them, do the opponents like to 
limp-in or raise with a pair of aces, do they play loosely from 
early position or are they conservative? 
The questions become even more complicated after the 
flop. Ask yourself, would one opponent bet so much if he had 
a flush draw? Does another player like to set traps on the flop 
and then go for the check-raise? 
There are so many variables to consider when putting your 
challenger on a hand, and the best way to figure things out is to 
ask yourself various questions. Then go to your memory bank 
for the answers. 
3. The third basic principle to think about is, "What do 
they think I have?" 
This is Level Three poker and relates to your table image, 
meaning how other players perceive you and the way you play 
your hands. 
Remember, while you are busy trying to figure out what 
your opponents have, they in turn are trying to figure out what 
you have as well. 
For example, if they've been paying attention and saw you 
bluff several hands in a row, they may have you pegged, making 
bluffing in this situation less effective for you. 
Conversely, they may figure you to be a weak, straight-
forward player who never bluffs. In this case, a well-timed bluff 
may work very well. Since you know they've been studying 
26 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
you too, try to take advantage of your perceived table image 
whenever you can. 
Understanding your table image is important, but feeding 
your memory bank, by paying attention to the game at all 
times, is essential. Remembering similar past hand situations, 
both how you and your competitor played, is crucial to your 
success in the current hand. 
Let's say the last time you flopped top pair you went for the 
check-raise, and in another hand you flopped a drawing hand 
and bet right out. Now, if you've flopped top pair again what 
you need to think about is this: If you bet right out this time, 
will he put you on a flush draw again, or will he think you're 
using reverse psychology? 
Chances are, if he's perceptive, your opponent will think 
your bet means you have a draw. What he doesn't know is that 
you've delved into your memory bank and are using that stored 
information against him. 
As you can probably imagine from this last example, there 
is no end to the old game of "I know, that you know, that I 
know, that you know." In essence, this is your introduction to 
Level Four poker: "What does he think I think he has?" 
The levels never really stop and that's when poker becomes 
more of a chess match. When both you and your opponent 
know so much about each other that you are constantly mixing 
up your game, using reverse psychology and maybe even some 
reverse-reverse psychology, you've reached a whole new plane. 
Just remember to always try and stay one step ahead of 
your opponents and you'll do just fine. 
27 
What Are You Looking At? 
You've no doubt heard the myth about needing a poker 
face to play the game well. I'm going to let you in on a little 
secret today. Poker isn't about reading facial tics—it's about 
reading people. 
What's the difference you ask? 
Well, when you hear the term, 'reading your opponent,' it 
doesn't necessarily mean that you are looking for body language 
clues. More often than not, the tells you're looking for come 
from reading your opponents' betting patterns. 
There is a famous poker player out there who claims that 
he can "see through your soul." No, he can't. Trust me. Some 
top pros might want you to believe that type of hype so they 
can garner a psychological edge over you. 
The truth is, an elite poker player doesn't focus much on 
body language. Instead, he tries to understand how you think 
based on the hands you play and how you play them. He isn't 
looking for some obscure nostril flare or eye twitch to make a 
decision, but you can bet he's delving into his memory bank 
and comparing notes from previous hands. 
28 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
He's likely asking himself questions such as, "How much 
did my opponent bet the last time he was bluffing?" Or, "When 
he flops three of a kind, does he usually check to trap me or 
does he bet right out to protect his hand?" 
So, those physical tells that television commentators like to 
go on about are for the most part a bunch of hogwash! Watch 
me on television and you'll see that I make all kinds of strange 
faces. Good luck trying to figure out what they mean. 
Reading tells and reading people are two separate skills that 
are often lumped together, but they are, in fact, very different. 
Reading tells is the ability to recognize the way people look 
when they are bluffing versus telling the truth. Reading people 
deals more with the ability to understand how someone thinks 
based on various clues you can put together. 
How to Read Tells 
The first thing you'll need to do is simply pay attention. 
This applies not only when you are in a hand, but also when 
you've folded and are waiting for the next deal. Study your 
opponents and look for any behavioral patterns you can find. 
For example, maybe you see one of your opponents cover 
his mouth before he pushes in a big bet. After the hand, he 
shows that he was bluffing. Does he also cover his mouth when 
he has a strong hand? If not, you may have just picked up a 
valuable tell. 
The more you practice this skill of picking up subtle clues 
about your opponents, the more pots you'll be picking up. 
How to Read People 
Now this is really where it's at. 
Poker is a game of people, first and foremost, and 
understanding how an opponent thinks will go a long way 
toward giving you a significant advantage over him. 
To do this, you need to think like a detective by putting clues 
29 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
together and trying to understand what they mean. This could 
be anything from studying what your opponent is wearing to 
ascertaining what he does for a living. People unwittingly reveal 
all kinds of clues about themselves. 
Here's a case study: 
A man with a hairy chest wearing an unbuttoned open 
shirt that reveals tons of gold chains sits at your table. He smells 
a little bit off, stacks his chips recklessly and smokes incessantly. 
His fingernails are dirty and he won't stop shaking his knee. 
Right off the bat, you know a good amount about this 
person, because you've already asked yourself this important 
question: Is he likely to be patient, scared, and conservative, 
or is he more likely to be an impatient, fearless, and aggressive 
player? 
If you guessed the former, you may want to find a new 
hobby like checkers or something. 
For more clues, now go ahead and ask him some questions. 
"What do you do for a living?" is always a good one. 
If he says he's a lawyer, well, you know who not to trust, 
right? 
If he claims he's a math teacher, chances are you're dealing 
with a very analytical player. 
Or, if he swears he's a Sunday school teacher, you might 
be dealing with someone who is uncomfortable telling lies, or, 
in this case, already bluffing. 
The bottom line: Reading tells and reading people are both 
very real skills, and, when used together, make for a deadly 
combination. 
30 
Home Run Hitters vs. Small Ball Players 
Anyone who knows anything about my approach to no-
limit hold'em understands that I'm a firm believer in the small 
ball theory rather than the riskier all-in approach to the game. 
Small ball, as it relates to poker, is a grind-it-out style of 
play that, while still aggressive, doesn't rely on big home run 
heroics. The small ball tournament approach looks to steadily 
increase your, chip count, while trying to avoid big risks in 
marginal situations. 
Before continuing, I must add the following disclaimer: 
Small ball is an extremely advanced strategy and should only 
be used by players with a good amount of experience. 
The reason that's true is because small ball depends heavily 
on hand reading skills. On top of that, it entails playing a lot of 
hands, and being faced with decisions that are more difficult.

Mizrachi, Erick Lindgren, Gus Hansen, myself, and a slew 
of other top no-limit hold'em players, all use the small ball 
approach. It's hardly a coincidence. 
Strangely enough, the advice I give the novice with regard 
31 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
to small ball is precisely the opposite advice I give to the 
advanced player. 
Beginners should stick to the home run approach by playing 
big bet poker with all-in bets when necessary. While that's not 
the optimal long-term strategy, it will help neutralize a better 
player's advantage over them. 
Think about that for a minute. 
When a rookie keeps going all-in every hand, he takes all 
the play away from his more experienced competition. The 
small ball expert wants to see a lot of flops cheaply so he can 
outplay novices after the flop. The all-in strategy negates that 
advantage, and the pro is relegated to being just another player 
waiting for a good hand. 
Now, of course, I'm not suggesting that you go all-in crazy. 
Large raises can often accomplish the same objective. 
As a rule, a beginning player should instead look to make 
large raises before the flop. When the blinds are $400-$800 with 
a $100 ante, the home run hitter should be raising to $4,000. 
There is reaEy no good reason to change the raise amount based 
on your cards. In fact, by raising the same amount with pocket 
aces as you would with A-10, you give away less information to 
your opponents. 
Conversely, a small ball veteran would likely raise the pot 
to about three times the big blind. So, if there are nine people 
seated at the table, with $2,100 in blinds and antes, the expert 
would raise about $2,000 to $2,400. 
While the beginning player was risking $4,000 to win 
$2,100 (laying nearly 2 to 1 odds on the hand), the small ball 
player is getting much better value—about even money. 
Another thing to think about is that the home run hitter 
won't get as much action as will the small ball player. Against 
the slugger, the big blind would have to call an additional 
$3,200 to see the flop; against the small ball player, he might 
only have to call $1,200, getting almost 3 to 1 odds. 
32 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
This is the essential difference that makes the home run 
style much easier to play. Sluggers simply don't have to make 
as many decisions after the flop. Small ball players, however, 
desperately want to see a lot of flops so that they can force 
opponents into more difficult decisions. 
The very best small ball players make poker look like 
controlled chaos. They're seemingly involved in every hand 
and are always keeping opponents on their heels. 
Consider one more sports analogy—boxing. The small ball 
player continually throws jabs while always keeping his guard 
up. His goal is to wait for the opportunity when his opponent 
makes a big mistake and opens up his chin. 
That's when he socks it to him with the big uppercut! 
33 
To Show or Not to Show? That is the Question 
There are two schools of thought when it comes to revealing 
your cards after everyone else has folded and the hand is over. 
One asks, why would you? Why give your opponents free 
information about how you play when they didn't pay for it? 
While I totally understand and respect this strategy, I 
believe that in certain situations, it can be advantageous to 
show opponents your cards. When you watch me play poker on 
television, notice that I often show my hand. Of course, I'm not 
doing this randomly. My reasoning is calculated, and designed 
to give me an edge that I can exploit later in the game. 
Think of it like this: I'm planting seeds that I can harvest 
later. You might consider doing a little poker gardening 
yourself. 
Here's how showing your hands can work to your benefit, 
particularly when you're up against novice players. 
1. Showing a bluff. 
Revealing your bluff hand might be good for your table 
34 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
image after you've successfully pushed your opponents out of 
the hand. 
Bad players tend to have very long memories. By showing 
just one of your bluffs, they may conclude that you try to steal 
all of the pots, all of the time. Later in the game, when you are 
dealt the best hand, you'll benefit because they will call you 
more often than they should. 
2. Showing a strong hand. 
There are two ways to make the most of this situation. If 
you are up against a weak player, showing him that you bet a 
strong hand will often allow you to bully him for the rest of the 
night. It will put the notion in his mind that when you bet, it's 
always because you have great cards, even if you don't. 
The other benefit in revealing a strong hand is that it may 
help to keep an aggressive player off your back. Aggressive 
players are the toughest to face, and quite frankly, you don't 
want them attacking you. 
An aggressive player will be less inclined to attack if he 
has evidence that you weren't messing around when you raised 
him earlier. Befriending an aggressive player by revealing your 
hand can actually tame him. 
You know what they say: Keep your friends close and your 
enemies closer. 
3. Setting up a play. 
Revealing a hand can have its benefits anytime you make 
a play that is out of the norm for you. Let's say, for example, 
in a limit hold'em game, you usually raise the bet when 
holding top pair. Only this time, you just call your opponent 
on the flop and then raise him on the turn when a safe card 
hits. 
If your opponent folds, showing your hand may lead him 
to believe that you make this play often. In the future, when 
35 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
you just call on the flop, he may worry that you'll raise him on 
the turn. 
Conversely, if you raise on the flop, he may think it's more 
likely you have a drawing hand, since your track record suggests 
that you always raise on the turn with top pair. 
Here's a very important rule. Don't engage in this type of 
psychological warfare if you are a novice player. In fact, you'd 
be much better off never revealing your hand unless you are 
obligated to do so. 
And one last piece of advice: Don't show your cards when 
squaring off against great players. Revealing your hand is much 
more effective against more easily manipulated opponents. 
Showing or not showing cards will always be a topic of 
great debate amongst poker's elite. In my book, revealing 
your hand to a weak opponent can often be an effective and 
profitable tactic. 
36 
Beating Up on the Weak Player 
If someone describes your playing style as weak, you're 
in lots of trouble. You'd better make changes to your game 
quickly to shed that reputation. 
If you want to win at the poker table, focus on the weak 
players. Rather than duke it out with strong, aggressive players, 
you'll risk less and win more in the long run, playing against 
timid, passive players. 
In order to pound on the shaky players properly, the first 
thing you'll need to do is identify them. There are generally a 
few clues that you can look for, that, while not always accurate, 
could be signs nonetheless. 
1. How he dresses. 
A player who dresses conservatively will generally play 
poker that way. If he dresses loudly, he'll more than likely play 
aggressively or flamboyantly. 
2. How he talks. 
This is in line with the previous clue. If a player is quiet 
37 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
or timid in the way he speaks, chances are that's how he'll 
play poker. Conversely, if you're dealing with a boisterous or 
overexcited talker, he'll probably be an aggressive player. 
3. Does he raise before the flop or just call? 
If he likes to limp in on a regular basis, you might be 
dealing with a weak player. 
4. Does he like to bet, or check and call? 
An aggressive player is a bettor, while a weaker player tends 
to check or just call others' bets. 
Once you've identified the weak players at your table, it's 
time to strategize against them. Playing against a weak player 
is, without a doubt, the easiest type of opponent to face. In fact, 
your cards often don't even matter since your inferior foe plays 
so predictably. 
The key principle to think about is to basically pound him 
like an anvil! Do it repeatedly—like the school bully who steals 
his target's lunch money—until he starts to stick up for himself. 
If he keeps giving it up, you keep taking it. 
Hey, no one said poker was supposed to be fair. 
When you have position on an ineffective player it makes 
it that much easier. What you really want to look for are 
opportunities to get the weak opponent heads-up. 
How do you do that? Well, when the helpless one limps 
into a pot you try to isolate him with a decent-sized raise. That 
will often knock everyone out but the timid player. Now you've 
got him where you want him. If the player is extremely weak, 
it doesn't even matter if you have a 7-2 in your hand. 
You really aren't playing your hand anyway, you're playing 
the player. 
If you are able to get the weak player heads up, with 
position, you'll let his actions, or lack of them, dictate what you 
38 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
should do. If he bets the flop, you can be pretty sure he has a 
good hand. If you don't flop a very good hand, now would be 
an excellent time to fold. You might be playing the player, but 
you can't ignore his bet entirely. 
If he checks the flop, then you should bet, regardless of 
what you have. If, however, your inept opponent check-raises 
you, run and hide! Unless, of course, you flop a strong hand 
yourself. The only time you may want to check is if you flop the 
nuts and want to give him a free card. Otherwise, you should 
always bet the flop and look to win the pot right there. 
The tricky decision comes when the weak player decides to 
just call, which he will often do. At that point you have to make 
a game-time decision as to whether your opponent flopped a 
drawing hand or a made hand. 
Since your opponent is weak, he won't give you much 
information about his hand by the way he plays it. Generally, 
an inadequate player will check and call with either a made 
hand (like top pair) or a flush draw. 
As a rule, proceed cautiously if a weak player calls you on 
the flop. If you have a good hand, by all means, bet. But if you 
are bluffing, lean towards checking on the turn card since the 
weak player has shown some interest. 
There is an old adage in poker that I think sums up that last 
point: "If you bluff a bad player you then become one." Stay 
aggressive against weak players, but don't get caught running 
without the ball when they show interest in the flop. 
39 
Bullying a Bully 
It can be really frustrating to have an extremely aggressive 
player at your table that just won't seem to leave you alone. No 
matter what you do, the bully keeps coming after you, especially 
if you aren't getting any good cards of your own. 
Hopefully, after reading this, you'll have all the tools you 
need to fight the good fight and start pounding back. If you 
know anything about a bully, you know that if you stand up to 
him, he'll usually run away and hide. 
Let him run, but get his chips first. 
To accomplish that, the first thing you need to understand 
is the bully's biggest weakness. It's that he likes to play lots of 
hands, and, when he does, he'll play them aggressively. Sooner 
or later, he'll cross the line between good, solid, aggressive play 
and become a maniac who bluffs too much and plays wildly. 
What you need to do is exploit his aggressive tendencies so 
that they work in your favor. 
When you sense that a bully is crossing that line, take a 
deep breath and give him as much rope as he needs to hang 
himself. By that I mean, trap him with your good hands and let 
40 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
him bluff off his money to you. There is actually a poker term 
for this maneuver: collecting bullets. 
Collecting bullets is an excellent way to keep a poker tyrant 
off your back. Try slowplaying to trap your opponent. This 
passive and clever tactic will win pots from the bully that, had 
you otherwise bet, would likely have prompted him to fold his 
cards. 
Remember, a bully looks to pounce on perceived weakness, 
just like one of those hooligans did in grade school. On the 
playground, you'd eventually need to stand up to the tormentor 
to get him off your back. In poker, though, you want to let him 
feel like he can run over you all day. Indeed, when you have a 
monster hand, your greatest desire is that he will pounce all 
over you. Let him do all the betting for you. 
Or, as a friend of mine, and fellow professional player, 
Layne Flack, says, "Why do the pushin' when the donkey will 
do the pullin'." 
It's very important and also financially rewarding to 
recognize situations where slowplay checking will win you more 
money than betting. The bully who bets when you check, but 
folds when you bet, is the perfect target for bullet collecting. 
Now, I don't want to leave you with only one anti-bullying 
strategy or you could end up like a sheep to the slaughter. There 
is more to it. There are times when you don't want to appear to 
be a pushover by letting the bully run the show. The advice I've 
given thus far works best when your opponent has position on 
you throughout the hand. 
However, when you have position on him, then it's time to 
stand up and show him who's boss. 
When you're in position, meaning that you are seated to 
the bully's left, be a thorn in his side by raising and reraising 
to take control of the hand. He usually won't have a strong 
enough hand to play and will fold. 
Here's the most crucial concept to master: Always make 
41 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
the bully think twice about stealing the blinds. You must 
make him believe that he could run into a buzzsaw at any 
moment—that buzzsaw being you! Once you've tamed the 
aggressive opponent, the door for you to become the bully has 
just opened. 
Since you're now the bully, your opponents will be leery of 
you and won't want to mess with you too often. Take advantage 
of this situation by stealing their blinds. If the other players 
don't stand up to you, keep being the aggressor and punish 
them until they do. 
And one last thought. Once you become the bully, beware 
of those motivated players who will try to take you down. Being 
bullied or being the bully both come with danger. 
42 
The Five Times Rule 
I'm assuming that many of you reading this book would 
consider yourself a beginning or novice poker player. If so, 
then the following no-limit Texas hold'em advice might just be 
perfect for you. 
There are a variety of poker books available that discuss 
what hands you should be starting with in tournament poker, 
but there isn't enough advice about how and how much you 
should be betting on those hands. 
Well, I'd like to introduce the five-times-the-big-blind-rule to 
you. It's basically as simple as it sounds. 
You should be raising five times whatever the big blind is. 
If the blinds are $25/$50, and you are the first one to enter the 
pot, you should raise the bet to $250 if you decide to play the 
hand. What this maneuver will do is give you a chance to really 
protect your hand by making your opponents pay a heavy price 
to see the flop. 
Strangely enough, it's the exact opposite advice I'd give to 
an advanced player. 
For the advanced player, I'd recommend raising to just two 
43 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
and a half to three times the big blind. Why? It's simple. A 
more skilled player makes better decisions after the flop than 
does a novice. So, as a beginning player, you want to see fewer 
flops for that very reason. 
Try not to let a more experienced player get to the flop 
because his skill advantage will then come into play. Your edge, 
as a rookie, will come from starting with stronger hands and 
betting them more aggressively before the flop. 
Now what if someone else has called the big blind in front 
of you? Well, the fives times rule now becomes the seven-times-
rule. If a player limps in for $50, you'd want to make it even 
more expensive to see the flop by making it $350. This betting 
system isn't without it's holes, mind you, but it will help less 
experienced players avoid getting involved in too many complex 
decisions after the flop. 
Always remember the general theory: If a hand isn't good 
enough to raise with, then you should fold it. 
Raise or fold poker is the best approach for a new player. 
On that note, what should you do if someone has raised the 
pot in front of you? 
If the blinds are now, for example, $50-$ 100, and another 
player comes in for a raise of $300, you should still use the five 
times rule. Only this time, you'll be raising it to five times the 
last bet. Five times the last bet of $300 is $1,500, and that's the 
bet I'd advise you to make. 
This strategy might seem a little too aggressive, but I 
assure you, it will give a beginning player the best opportunity 
to succeed. As your game improves, and you feel more 
comfortable making good decisions after the flop, then you can 
make smaller raises before the flop and start entering the pot 
for about three times the blind. 
There is one last rule I'd like to share with you that deals 
with pre-flop betting in tournament poker. It's called the 30 
percent rule. 
44 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
If your standard raise of five times the big blind is more 
than 30 percent of your total stack, then just go ahead and 
move all in. 
This is one of the deadliest weapons in your arsenal, as it's 
extremely difficult to defend against. In order for your opponents 
to call such a large bet, they'll have to have a premium hand 
like A-A, K-K, or A-K. They can't outplay you anymore since 
your decision has already been made. 
It's important to remember that following these rules isn't 
necessarily the optimal strategy, but they will help any beginner 
go farther in tournaments and give him or her a much better 
chance of actually cashing in. It's certainly not how I, as a 
professional player, choose to play, but it is a style that gives me 
fits to play against. 
It forces a pro to rely more heavily on the luck of the cards, 
and as a novice, that's exactly what you want to do. 
45 
Aggressive Play vs. Conservative Play 
I'd like to set the record straight right here and now; if 
you want to win big money playing tournament poker you are 
going to have to play aggressively. It's simply not a coincidence 
that all of the players you see on TV winning millions of dollars 
have one thing in common: aggressiveness. 
So what exacdy does it mean to be aggressive at the poker 
table? Well, the idea behind it is to push the limits, fight for lots 
of pots, and get active in the game. 
The opposing strategy would be to sit back, wait for 
premium hands, and hope that someone plays with you when 
you do. There are several key problems with the conservative 
strategy. 
1. You won't be dealt enough premium hands to stay 
afloat. 
In no-limit hold'em tournaments, the blinds and antes 
continue to escalate, which force you to gamble. If you just 
sit there and wait for A-A or K-K, you'll end up anteing 
yourself to death! 
46 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
2. You'll become too predictable. 
If everyone sees that you aren't playing very many hands, 
they'll know when you do enter a pot that you have a monster. 
Thus, if they have marginal hands, they won't give you the 
action you desire. 
3. No one will fear you. 
If your opponents pick up on the fact that you're playing 
very conservatively, they will repeatedly attack your blinds 
knowing that you won't call unless you happen to have a strong 
hand. That's not the image you want. You'd be much better off 
known as a pest who won't let the others breathe. 
The key to being a successfully aggressive player is to do 
so in a selective manner. Going overboard with a hard-hitting 
approach can easily turn into just being reckless. In fact, let me 
introduce a new term: cautious aggression. While those two 
words would seem to contradict each other, they really don't 
at all. Here's how a cautiously aggressive player approaches 
no-limit play. 
A cautiously aggressive player will raise more than his fair 
share of pots. He's looking to pick up the blinds, first, or the pot 
on the flop, second, while hoping to make a strong hand, third. 
If he finds any resistance from his opponents, he'll duck and 
cover by throwing his cards away unless he has a very strong 
hand himself. 
If you think of it in boxing terms, a cautiously aggressive 
player will throw lots of jabs but will always guard his chin. 
He's constantly jabbing while dodging his foe's punches. 
When his adversary gets sloppy and leaves his own chin 
open, the cautiously aggressive player will send him to the 
canvas with one knockout punch. 
On the surface it seems like a brute, chaotic approach, but 
47 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
realistically, it's all rooted in basic mathematical rules. Let me 
show you what I mean. 
At a nine-handed table, the blinds are $400/$800 with a 
SI00 ante. Already there is $2,100 in the pot ($400 small blind, 
$800 big blind, and $900 in antes). An aggressive player may 
decide to raise the bet to $2,000, risking $2,000 to win $2,100 
if everyone folds. 
One thing we know about hold'em is that it's very difficult 
to pick up a premium two-card combination. If the aggressive 
player is up against a table full of conservative opponents, he'll 
grab the blinds well over 50 percent of the time. 
But what about those times when it doesn't work? 
If an opponent does call, the aggressive player must now 
proceed with caution. Moreover, if the conservative opponent 
reraises, the cautiously aggressive player must make a key 
adjustment by cutting his losses, throwing away the hand, and 
trying to steal the next pot. 
That is, of course, unless the aggressive player himself has 
a premium hand. When that occurs, he gets a chance to throw 
that knockout punch. Since he's been playing so many hands, 
the aggressive player is more likely to get action even when he 
has the nuts. So again, it's jab-jab-jab, duck and cover, then 
throw the knockout punch. 
Everybody hates playing against an aggressive player, and 
for good reason. They are difficult to read and they're always 
putting the pressure on you. Why not be that guy? Why not be 
the bully pushing everyone else around? You are there to win 
after all. 
48 
The Deadly All-in Bet 
One of the things viewers like most about watching no-
limit Texas hold'em on television is the all-or-nothing nature of 
a game. It's a battle where the player, at any point, can decide 
to risk it all on the turn of a card. 
The all-in bet is certainly exciting, and it's also a very 
deadly weapon, especially in tournament poker where the 
blinds escalate rapidly. When used properly, all-in betting can 
have a neutralizing effect on even the world's greatest players. 
In fact, if you found yourself in a situation where you were 
facing professional champions like Johnny Chan or Phil Ivey, 
the all-in move might just be your only hope. 
Here's why it works. 
Only strong hands can call. 
Once you've made an all-in bet, it forces opponents to have 
a premium hand in order to call you. When all of your chips 
are in the pot, opponents can't outplay you anymore because 
your decision-making process is already complete. 
If you're a novice player, the last thing you want to do is 
49 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
be involved in difficult situations against a superior player after 
the flop. So consider making your big move before the flop, 
and turn a world-class cardshark into nothing more than just 
another player waiting for a premium hand. 
While he's waiting, you'll be picking up valuable blinds and 
antes. 
Even when you get caught, you can still win. 
The second reason the all-in move is so effective is that 
even when you get caught with your hand in the cookie jar, you 
can still win the pot. 
Let's say you go all-in on the button with a trash hand like 
A * 6 4 . The big blind picks up a hand like K * K * and calls. 
Well, you're obviously in trouble, but it's nowhere near as bad 
as you might think. You'll outdraw the cowboys and win the 
pot over 28 percent of the time. 
Now, if the players in the blinds are top-notch and are 
waiting for big pairs before they'll play against you, you'll pick 
up the blinds a very high percentage of the time. And when 
you add in the success rate of your hand outdrawing a calling 
opponent, it makes the all-in play effective in most situations. 
Math is on your side. 
In tournament poker, the game is played with blinds as 
well as antes. Winning a hand where absolutely nobody calls is 
often an excellent result and a great way to increase your stack 
size—risk free. 
Let's say, for example, that the blinds are $200/$400, with 
eight players tossing in an ante of $50 each. There is $1,000 in 
the pot. Everyone folds to you. You're holding A * - 3 * on the 
button and have $10,000 left. 
If you go all-in and nobody calls, you'll have increased your 
stack size by 10 percent simply by having the guts to risk it all. 
50 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
Even if your opponents call you with a better hand 10 percent 
of the time, the play would still be profitable in the long run. 
Why? As I explained earlier, even a hand like A-6 will beat 
a pair of kings close to 30 percent of the time. 
So, nine times out of ten you'll end up with $ 11,000 
in chips by picking up the blinds and antes. One out of ten 
times, you'll either be done for the day, or get lucky, and amass 
$20,400 in chips. 
Now, remember, this isn't a foolproof system, and it isn't 
the optimal strategy for a top professional. However, it is the 
best way for a beginning player to neutralize a professional's 
significant skill advantage. 
One last thing: If you're contemplating an all-in play, it's 
also extremely important to factor in your stack size in relation 
to the blinds. The larger the discrepancy, the less effective the 
all-in move becomes. 
Suppose that in the previous example, you now have 
$100,000 in chips instead of $10,000. Moving all-in with a 
trash hand is no longer a good strategy, even for a beginner. 
Risking $100,000 and your whole tournament life to win a 
measly $ 1,000 simply isn't worth it. 
51 
Betting Basics: When Less is More 
Situations will arise in no-limit Texas hold'em when a 
smaller bet will actually give you more bang for your buck. 
More specifically, there are times when betting half the pot will 
give you the same amount of information as betting the whole 
pot. 
This is a relatively simple concept, especially among top 
tier players, but it's a strategy that many novice and average 
players haven't fully grasped. 
Let's look at an example to help clarify this point. Suppose 
you are playing no-limit hold'em and raised before the flop 
with A-10. Only the player in the big blind called you, so you 
continue play heads-up with $700 in the pot. 
The flop comes K * 8 A 4 > . The big blind checks to you. 
You decide to bet in the hope that your opponent missed the 
flop and will fold. The question is, how much should you bet? 
Well, if you bet the whole pot, $700, you'll definitely 
find out if your opponent is serious about continuing with 
the hand. If he calls the pot-sized bet, chances are he has a 
better hand than your ace high. 
52 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
While we know we can get that information with a $700 
bet, the pertinent questions are: Do you really need to risk the 
whole $ 7 00 to gather that information? Would the outcome be 
any different had you bet, say, $450? 
Probably not. A pot-sized bet and a bet of approximately 
one-half the pot will yield about the same information. 
However, the smaller bet is often a much better choice for 
several reasons: 
1. When you are bluffing, you'll be risking fewer chips 
when you get caught. 
Remember, if you are attempting to flat-out steal the pot, 
betting one-half, three-quarters, or even the full pot will all 
generally give you sufficient information as to whether your 
opponent hit the flop. 
So in this situation, why risk betting the whole pot when a 
smaller bet would accomplish the same objective? 
2. When you actually have a good hand and want your 
opponents to play with weaker hands, they'll be more 
likely to call a bet of one-half the pot rather than a full 
pot-sized bet. 
If you have a monster hand and are looking for action, 
betting half the pot will get you a few more loose calls, and 
that's exacdy what you want. 
3. The math is on your side. 
Virtually every poker situation can be broken down into a 
simple mathematical formula. If there is $600 in a pot and you 
bet $600, you'll be getting even money on your proposition. 
That means, in the long run, you'd have to win that pot half 
of the time to make it a profitable play. (Note: There are other 
factors that come into play on the next two cards, but let's 
ignore that for this example.) 
53 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
When you consider that the hand will play out almost 
identically with a $400 bet, you'll see that, mathematically, it 
often makes sense to choose the smaller bet. 
If you bet $400, you'd be risking $400 to win $600, meaning 
that you'd be getting 3 to 2 odds rather than even-money. The 
smaller bet will achieve virtually the same result as the bigger 
bet but would only have to pay off 40 percent of the time rather 
than 50 percent of the time had you bet the whole pot. 
You will rarely see a top professional bet all of what's in 
the pot when you watch poker on television. They'll vary their 
bets generally between one-third, one-half, and three-quarters 
of the pot. They understand that by keeping the pots smaller, 
they'll have more control over the outcome. And that's just 
what they want—to maintain control of the table. 
Amateurs, on the other hand, will often make oversized 
bets out of fear. They worry that a superior player will be able 
to outplay them if they don't make a sizeable bet. Frankly, that 
thinking isn't too far off base. 
Playing small-bet poker is for professionals and for those 
who aspire to improve their games to a professional level. If 
that's not where you are, it just might make sense for you to 
swing for the fences. 
54 
The Value of Suited Cards 
In Texas hold'em it would seem pretty obvious that a 
suited hand—both cards being of the same suit—is better 
than an unsuited, or offsuit hand. 
It doesn't take a genius to figure out that KvJV is a better 
starting hand than K<fcJ>, but the real question is, how much 
better is a suited hand versus an unsuited hand? 
To better understand that question, it's important to note a 
few key factors that distinguish these two hands. The main one 
being that suited hole cards will only complete a flush about 5 
percent of the time. 
That certainly doesn't seem like much, but poker is a game 
of slim edges and subtle nuances. While you'll only make that 
flush one in twenty times, having four cards to a flush draw can 
also win you the pot in other ways. 
For example, if you were to flop a flush draw you might try 
a semibluff, or bet on the come. This would give you two ways to 
win: You either complete your flush, or your bet scares everyone 
else out of the pot and you win it right there. 
There are even more ways that suited cards can be of 
55 
Cardoza Publishing * Daniel Negreanu 
benefit. Let's say you had that KvJV hand and the flop came 
8 v 5 v 2 * giving you a flopped flush draw. In this case, you 
could continue on to the river in the hopes of catching your 
flush. Sometimes, though, you'll catch a pair of jacks or kings 
along the way that could also win you the pot. 
Now, compare that with the K-J offsuit. This unsuited 
hand would probably be forced to fold on the flop while the 
suited hand could take the pot. 
One more consideration in favor of the suited hand is 
that you'll often win very large pots when you do complete a 
powerful flush. Whether playing limit or no-limit, it's a hand 
that can pay off big dividends in the right situations. 
Based on all this information, it would seem that being 
suited is a monstrous advantage. There are drawbacks, 
however, especially for beginning players who fall in love with 
these drawing hands. 
Hey, I don't blame them, suited cards can be tempting to 
play, but players will too often use the fact that a hand is suited 
as an excuse to play all sorts of trashy cards. 
I don't care if your 7-2 is suited or not, it's still a garbage 
hand! The same holds true for a 9-3, 10-4 or Qj2. A hand 
being suited just isn't worth the trouble it can cause. 
It can also be very costly to your bankroll if you are always 
chasing flush draws, especially if you are playing no-limit 
hold'em. Ponder this one: Having a four card flush draw, after 
the flop, sure feels like a powerful hand, but even then you'll 
only complete your draw about one third of the time. For 
the record, that means you won't complete it two out of three 
times. 
Other problems can arise when you make your flush but 
still lose the pot to a player that makes a higher flush. Let's 
say you played a K * 3 * and made a powerful flush on a final 
board that reads Q * 6 * 2 v 7 * 9 * . 
Only one hand could possibly beat you: the ace-high flush. 
56 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
If, however, you are facing that one hand, it will likely cost you 
a ton of money since your formerly powerful hand is too strong 
to surrender. In this case, you'd be destined to lose all your 
chips when your opponent goes all-in. 
So what then is the final word on suited cards? 
Well, they're obviously better than unsuited cards, but not 
as much as you might think. Beginning players often misplay 
suited hands by gambling on the slim odds that they'll make 
their flush. Conversely, a real pro knows the true value of these 
hands and gets the most out of them. For him, suited cards give 
him even more weapons to win the pot. He knows that suited 
cards open up options for landing the flush, playing a semibluff, 
hitting top pair, or folding the hand if the flop comes up dry.

Stealing Blinds 
During televised poker tournaments, you'll often here the 
commentators talk about stealing blinds. 
They are referring to a situation when a player, holding a 
junk hand, raises before the flop, hoping to win the blinds and 
antes without a fight. 
It's a very effective and profitable strategy when handled 
properly. In fact, one of the key elements that differentiate a 
great tournament player from an average one is the way he 
utilizes this effective poker tactic. 
If you want to be a great player too, you must learn how to 
perfect this legal form of stealing. 
Because blinds and antes escalate so quickly in a 
tournament, you just don't have all day to wait for premium 
hands. You have to get involved by trying to steal some blinds 
just to stay afloat. Otherwise, your stack will dwindle and you'll 
ante yourself right out of the tournament. 
Here are a few important things you need to think about 
when attempting to steal blinds. 
58 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
1. Who's in the Big Blind. 
When you're considering raising the big blind, it's extremely 
important to consider who the player is and how he plays. If 
he's a very loose, aggressive type, then attempting to steal his 
blind might prove foolish since he will defend it much of the 
time. 
Instead, look to attack the blind of a tight or weak player; 
you know, the Rock of Gibraltar who only plays when he has 
aces or kings. He should be your target since you'll get away 
with this highway robbery often enough to make the play 
profitable. 
2. Your Position at the Table. 
Stealing blinds from late position works better than from 
early position for one simple reason: there are fewer players 
to act behind you. If you are trying to steal the blinds from 
first position at a nine-handed table, you'd have to get by eight 
other players, hoping none of them pick up a hand worthy of a 
call. That's unlikely. If, however, you attempt to steal from the 
button position, you'd only have to contend with two players, 
the little blind and the big blind. 
3. Your Table Image. 
If you've been pegged as an overly aggressive bluffer, it 
will become more difficult for you to steal their blinds. If, for 
example, they've watched you raise three hands in a row, and 
you also had to show a junk hand like 7-2 offsuit, then your 
steal attempts will likely be contested, as your cover has been 
blown. 
So, if you feel like your competitors are on to you, it's time 
to throw them a curve ball and wait for a strong hand to bust 
them out. 
59 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
Conversely, if your opponents see you as a rock, you then 
need to exploit that image by being selectively aggressive. It 
should be easier for you to steal blinds with a tight image, but 
you don't want to overdo it, because you'd be risking your 
image. It's a balancing act that you'll get the hang of with some 
experience. 
4. Your Stack Size. 
If you find yourself short-stacked in a tournament, it will 
have a major effect on your ability to use blind stealing as a 
weapon. Since other players will realize that you aren't a major 
threat to their stack, they might decide to play marginal hands 
against you hoping to knock you out. 
So ideally, as a short stack, you want to avoid stealing blinds 
entirely. But if you feel like you've found a truly good situation 
to attempt it, put all of your eggs in one basket and go all-in. 
If, however, you find yourself sitting pretty with a big stack, 
use all of that muscle to collect more chips off of the shorter 
stacks. 
There's an old saying, "Making your first million is the 
hard part. Once you do that, making money is easy." 
That's what life is like as a big stack. You have the luxury 
of being able to mug them in broad daylight against shorter-
stacked opponents who know full well that you are stealing 
their blinds, but simply can't do anything about it. 
To become an accomplished blind stealer you need to 
really pay attention to everything that's going on at the table. It 
takes more than random thought. You need to focus on these 
key factors: whose blinds should you steal, what seat you're in, 
do opponents see you as a thief, and how much ammunition 
you have. 
One last thing, keep an eye out for the player who gets 
frustrated by your steals. His blind is usually up for grabs!

Be Careful What You Learn on TV 
While watching televised poker is an excellent way to learn 
how to play the game, you really need to be careful about how 
you interpret what you're seeing. 
The key point to remember is that you're watching an 
edited-down poker show. You're not seeing all the hands 
played, and that can give you a skewed version of what is really 
happening. 
For example, you might have seen me make a bluff in 
a certain situation that looked foolish because my opponent 
called. What you might not have seen, however, is how that silly 
bluff paid off later in the game. 
There is always more to the story than what you see on 
television. 
ESPN's coverage is fantastic, but the product is basically a 
highlight reel of an all-day final table. It would be impossible 
to tell the whole story in the amount of airtime that they have, 
so you're left seeing crowd-pleasing confrontations like A-K 
against a pair of jacks. 
You might be wondering how these players get so many 
61 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
great hands. Well, they don't. You're seeing the most exciting 
hands from a nine-hour final. 
The Travel Channel's poker show, World Poker Tour, is a 
little closer to reality. Two hours are dedicated to each WPT 
broadcast, and the final table generally lasts between four to 
five hours. However, there are also inherent problems with 
learning from this show. 
Although you're seeing a much higher percentage of 
hands, play is distorted by the fact that the blinds escalate so 
quickly that the element of skill is reduced. As a result, you'll 
see players going all-in with K-5 and other players calling with 
hands like K-10. 
That's not real poker, and if you operate this way in a 
normal tournament setting, you're playing far too recklessly 
and aggressively. 
Television's best teaching tool is undoubtedly GSN's High 
Stakes Poker. This program brings together professionals and 
amateurs, including the likes of Los Angeles Lakers owner 
Dr. Jerry Buss and Las Vegas casino owner Bob Stupak, in an 
actual cash game setting. The blinds don't escalate and the goal 
isn't necessarily to get all the money. 
Players compete for cash that they put up themselves. I 
actually plopped down a million bucks to play in this game. Sure, 
I was paid $ 1,250 per hour to be on the show, but if the cards 
didn't go my way, I could have lost my entire investment. 
High Stakes Poker takes 24 hours of footage and breaks it 
down into a 13-week series. The play is very sophisticated and 
as close to watching high stakes live poker as you're going to 
get. Even with this show, I'd add the following caution at the 
bottom of the screen: Viewer discretion is advised. Do not try 
these plays at home! 
Why? Again, the play is very advanced. Copying these 
moves and trying them on your buddies at your home game 
might not work so well. Yes, some of these plays can be deadly 
62 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
in the right hands, but they can also ruin an inexperienced 
player who attempts them. 
Still, watching poker on television is the best way to learn 
how to play no-limit hold'em—short of actually sitting down 
at a real table. The key is to understand what you're watching 
and take everything with a grain of salt. 
It's important to understand that players on ESPN don't 
get better cards than those on The Travel Channel. On top of 
that, television likes to show the craziest hands. Going all-in 
with J-6 isn't such a great idea, even if you've seen Gus Hansen 
try it on the World Poker Tour. 
By all means, learn what you can from the professionals 
on television, but understand you're seeing only the tip of the 
proverbial poker iceberg. 
63 
Pondering Pocket Jacks 
Many Texas hold'em players hate getting dealt two jacks 
because they feel they're unlucky with them. Well, chances are, 
it isn't that they're unlucky with these cards. They're simply 
overvaluing the hand and misplaying it. 
In hold'em, the best hands you can get are A-A, K-K, 
Q-Q, and then J-J. However, there is a significant difference 
between the strength of the jacks and the queens. With queens, 
there are only two overcards—cards higher than a queen— 
that could hit on the flop and make Q-Q, vulnerable. 
With pocket jacks, however, there are three overcards that 
could flop, making the hand more difficult to play. And by the 
way, this situation happens quite often. 
If an overcard doesn't flop, you still have a whole new set 
of potential worries, such as coordinated boards like: 4-5-7, 3-
4-5, 6-7-8. If an opponent is playing a little pair, slowplaying 
a bigger pair, or is lucky enough to flop a straight, you're 
doomed. 
Pocket jacks is the one hand that seems too strong to fold 
yet not strong enough to hold if there is much action ahead 
I 
64 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
of you. If you're playing a structured limit hold'em game, the 
impact isn't as severe. However, in no-limit hold'em where 
your entire bankroll is in jeopardy, pocket jacks must be played 
very carefully. 
In fact, in a no-limit game, it's not difficult to picture 
situations where you should fold them before the flop. Think 
about it for a second. 
Let's say an early position player raises the blind, and then 
a very tight player reraises all-in right behind. As you look down 
at your pocket jacks, the fourth best pair in the deck, you have to 
ask yourself, what in the world could they have? 
Well, they could both have a hand like A-K, in which case 
you'd be getting good odds on your money. More often than 
not, though, one of them will be holding a pair bigger than 
yours. 
It's not a stretch to imagine that the first player might have 
a hand like A-Q, and the all-in raiser is sitting with a pair of 
kings in the hole. In this case, you'd be a 4 to 1 underdog to win 
the pot if it's played to the end, and that's not a good thing. 
There are countless dilemmas you'll face when holding a 
pair of jacks, and it's the reason so many people despise the 
hand. 
Frankly, unless a jack hits the flop, you'll never feel too safe. 
Now, that's not to say that you should automatically fold on 
the flop if you don't catch a third jack, not at all. Instead, try 
to protect your hand on the flop with a good size bet. But if 
someone does call, you had better be willing to abort mission. 
Fast. 
For example, if you bet and the flop comes A-9-4, make 
one stab at the flop, trying to gauge information about your 
opponent's hand. If he calls or raises in this spot, what do you 
think he might have? Chances are he's holding an ace, which 
only gives you a 7 percent chance of winning the pot. 
However, if the flop comes 9-6-2, it's tough to fold your 
65 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
pocket jacks. The only playable hands that can beat you are 
2-2, 6-6, 9-9, Q;Q,, K-K, or A-A. In this scenario, bet your 
hand aggressively, but if your opponent raises, wow, now you 
have a much tougher decision! 
The key here, as with most poker problems, is sizing up 
your opponent. If he holds aces, kings, or queens, would he 
have raised big before the flop? Is he the type of player that 
calls with small pairs before the flop? When he flops three of a 
kind, does he usually bet it aggressively or play it slow to suck 
more people in? 
In the end, you'll have to make a judgment call. Playing 
pocket jacks makes for some of the toughest decisions you'll 
ever face in poker, but hey, no one ever said this game would 
be easy. 
66 
What's the Big Deal About Big Slick? 
When you watch poker on TV you'll hear the commentators 
refer to A-K as a monster hand. Commonly known as Big Slick, 
A-K is often grouped with hands like A-A, K-K, and Q - Q 
This is a big mistake. 
Sure, it's nice to look down at your hole cards and find an 
A-K, but more often than not, if you end up playing a big pot 
with this hand you'll be statistically behind. The most likely 
event is a coin flip situation, where the outcome is close to 
50-50. 
The following statistic should open your eyes a bit. Did you 
know that a pocket pair of deuces will beat A-K 53 percent of 
the time? 
Yes, that's right. Even a lowly pair of deuces is a favorite 
over powerful Big Slick. It's even worse off against some other 
premium starting hands it will often face. 
67 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
Here is how A-K does against the top five pairs: 
• Against pocket tens, jacks, or queens, Big Slick will win 
only 43 percent of the time. 
• Versus pocket kings, Big Slick will win only 30 percent of 
the time. 
• And against pocket aces, your A-K in the hole will lose a 
whopping 93 percent of the time! 
As you can see, it's hardly a coin flip when Big Slick is up 
against these premium pairs, especially against two cowboys 
or pocket aces. Of course, your opponent won't always have a 
pair, and when he doesn't, that's when Big Slick starts looking 
like a monster, especially if there's an ace or a king in your 
opponent's hand. 
If your opponent held K-Q_or A-O^unsuited, for example, 
you would have him dominated, as he would only have one 
live card (queen) to outdraw you. In either of these scenarios 
your Big Slick would be a substantial favorite and will win 74 
percent of the time. 
There is one other interesting group of hands that Big 
Slick might match up against: two live cards that are suited, 
like 7 * 8 * . In this case, Big Slick will win 58 percent of the 
time. You're still a real favorite here, and there always seems to 
be someone who'll be willing to play you. 
These examples give you a litde statistical background on 
this enigma of a hand. In some cases Big Slick is quite strong, 
while in others it's extremely vulnerable. 
In knowing this, the key to playing A-K before the flop 
is to avoid getting involved in big pots when your entire stake 
is on the line. Too often when your opponent is willing to 
put all of his money up against you, he'll have the dreaded 
68 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
A-A or K-K which would make you a substantial underdog to 
win the hand. 
If you find yourself in a no-limit hold'em tournament 
looking down at Big Slick, you want to be aggressive with it 
and attack the blinds. If, however, you receive any resistance 
from your opponents, you should seriously consider folding the 
hand and waiting for a better situation. 
Here are a few other things to think about before you make 
a move with Big Slick: 
1. How many chips do you have? 
If you're short-stacked and need to win a big pot to get 
back in the game, then you should be very aggressive witii Big 
Slick and go all in. But if you have a good pile of chips and 
another player at the table raises you big time, well then, you 
likely don't need to get involved in this marginal situation. 
2. How do your opponents play? 
This is a very important consideration when making up 
your mind about playing Big Slick. If the Rock of Gibraltar, 
a player who is extremely conservative, reraises you, you 
can be pretty sure that he has a pair that just might be 
A-A or K-K. On the flipside, if your opponent is wild and 
reckless, your Big Slick might match up well against a hand like 
A-J or even K-10 and you'll be in great shape. 
The important thing to understand about Big Slick is that 
it's a drawing hand. Sure, if it's suited, it makes it the most 
powerful drawing hand you can be dealt in Texas hold'em. But 
remember, it's still a drawing hand. In the end, it's often only 
good enough to win with if you pair your ace or king, or get 
lucky enough to make a straight or a flush. 
Playing Big Slick smartly assures you of advancement, and 
once in awhile it actually earns that monster title so many have 
given it.

Top Ten Trouble Hands 
When you're playing no-limit Texas hold'em, there are 
certain cards dealt that are known as trouble hands. They earn 
this label because they're difficult to play and oftentimes are 
dominated by better hands. 
Here are the top ten trouble hands to watch out for: 
J-8 
The trouble with this hand comes when the flop is 
Q_-10-9, giving you the second best straight. If an opponent 
is playing K-J, a hand most players would play, you're simply 
doomed to lose everything you have. It would take a miracle, 
or a ridiculously good read on your part, to get away from this 
trap. 
A-10 
While it's an excellent hand in blackjack, the A-10 
doesn't fare nearly so well in Texas hold'em. Here's the 
problem: If you happen to catch another ace on the flop, 
A-K, A-Q_ and A-J will all have you beat. Add to that, if the 
70 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
flop comes A-7-4, for example, you'll lose to A-7, A-4, A-A, 
7-7, and 4-4. The only time you can really feel safe with A-10 
is when you flop two pair or make a straight. 
K-Q 
It looks like a powerful hand, but you have to be careful 
with this one. While K - Q will be okay much of the time, if 
someone has raised the pot in front of you, he may hold A-A, 
K-K, Q,-Q,, A-K, or A-Q. Your hand is totally dominated. If 
the flop is Qj7-2, you'll have a powerful pair with a powerful 
kicker, but you'll also be trapped. Now you're forced to put 
more money in the pot and are doomed against Q,-Q,, K-K, 
A-A, or A-Q. 
A-x suited 
These hands look very appealing because they're two parts 
of a powerful ace-high flush. Be careful, though, not to fall in 
love with drawing hands in no-limit, as you'll often be forced to 
pay an all-in bet to try to complete the flush. Another problem 
with this hand; if you're playing AV6V and flop an ace, your 
kicker will usually lose to anyone else who is also playing an 
ace. 
K-10 
It's just not a very strong hand and should be folded in the 
face of a raise. If you catch a king on the flop, you have kicker 
trouble. If you flop the 10, you'll have to worry about A-10 and 
all of the overpairs: J-J, Q7Q,, K-K, and A-A. 
A-J 
Here's another hand that's ideal for winning small pots but 
destined to lose big ones unless you make a straight, flush or two 
pair. If the flop comes, say, A-8-3, and your opponent makes 
a big bet, you'll be forced to play the guessing game. Does he 
71 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
have A-K or A-Q? Did he flop two pair or maybe three of 
a kind? Unfortunately, with A-J you'll often be guessing more 
and winning less. 
Q.-9 
The problem here is the same you faced with the J-8. 
When a flop comes K-J-10, you'll be doomed to lose all of your 
money to a player with A-Q On top of that, if you hit your 
pair of queens, your kicker will almost surely be beat. 
K-J 
This is known as the rookie hand. It seems too good to 
fold, but not quite strong enough to raise with. As a general no-
limit hold'em rule, if it's not good enough to raise with, then 
it's not good enough to call with. The big problem with the K-J 
is that it's dominated by too many hands your opponents would 
likely play: A-A, K-K, Q,-0_, J-J, A-K, and A-J. 
J-J 
It's the fourth best pocket pair in the deck, but when 
someone else puts it all-in against you, the decision with pocket 
jacks is excruciating. Even if you call correctly, and your 
opponent has a hand like A-K, you'll still only win the pot a 
little more than half the time. If you guess wrong, and your 
opponent is holding Q-Q, K-K, or A-A, well, then you're a 4 
to 1 underdog. 
And the drum roll please... 
A-Q 
Ask any pro what hand they hate most and A-Qwill be right 
at the top of the list. Why? Well, because it is a strong hand in 
most situations, but when you're up against the dreaded A-K 
you'll be almost a 3 to 1 underdog to win the pot! 
72 
Isolating Your Opponent in Limit Hold'em 
While no-limit Texas hold'em is the game you'll usually see 
being played for millions of dollars on television, limit hold'em 
remains the most popular form of poker today. 
The games are basically die same; the only difference is how 
you can bet your hands. No-limit hold'em players understand 
that their game is one of trapping. However, successful limit 
hold'em players recognize that their game is all about brute 
aggression. 
I will share with you a very smart play that deals specifically 
with limit hold'em: isolating your opponent with position. 
Position is power in any form of poker, but it's of no use if 
you don't use that power effectively. How do you do that? Well, 
here's a good way to start. 
Understand, while you'll always want to play powerful 
position poker, it simply doesn't work in very loose games. It 
will only prove successful in tighter games where two or three 
people stay in to see the flop. So, if you're sitting at a table 
where five or six players continually call to see flops, you'll be 
73 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
better served to tuck this information away until you move up 
in limits and face more advanced players. 
To best explain how to use position as power, let's look at 
an example. 
Let's say you're in a $10/$20 limit hold'em game and 
everyone has folded to the player directly on your right who 
raises the bet to $20. You, on the dealer button, look down at a 
pair of fives and face your first dilemma—call, reraise or fold? 
In this case, calling the bet would be the worst of the 
three choices. A call here would only serve to invite the two 
players behind you in the blinds to also call. It's important to 
understand, that while a hand like 5-5 is a favorite heads-up 
against a hand like A-K, any low pair will fare rather poorly 
against two opponents. 
For that reason, do everything you can to make this a 
heads-up pot by reraising, or three-betting as it's also known, to 
put extra pressure on the blinds and the initial raiser. 
Let's take our example one step further and assume 
that both players in the blind fold back to the original raiser 
who calls your raise. Then the flop comes J * 7 * 3 * . If your 
opponent checks on the flop, continue to be aggressive and bet 
the flop. 
Remember, he has no idea what you have. 
If your opponent has a hand like A-K or A-Qhe might just 
give up right here fearing that you have a pair of aces or kings. 
If he calls, well, that's fine, too, because your litde pair now 
becomes close to an 85 percent favorite. 
Alternatively, let's suppose the flop comes A-K-9. It 
certainly doesn't look very good for your little pair of fives. But 
again, since your opponent has no idea what you have, if he 
checks, go ahead and bet the flop. 
In this case, if your opponent has a hand like 8-8, he'll 
have a difficult time calling your bet since the flop was lousy for 
74 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
him too. You can win this pot with the worst hand by simply 
playing your position aggressively. 
Here's a key thing to think about: When playing limit 
hold'em from the power position, keep the lead by making sure 
that you're the aggressor. 
I used a pocket pair of fives in this example, but it really 
doesn't matter what hand you have when using the isolation 
play. You can do it with hands like A-K, A-Q_, or even 8-9 
suited, or K-Qoffsuit. 
Your goal is to isolate the initial raiser, hope that he misses 
the flop, and then to apply maximum pressure until he folds. 
Of course, you're going to get caught from time to time, 
but that's okay. The key to using this play effectively is also 
knowing when to give up on it. If your opponent comes back at 
with you with a raise, it's time to put on the brakes unless you're 
confident you have him beat.

Playing Trash Hands 
You might ask yourself why a top-notch player like Gus 
Hansen plays cards like 9-2 offsuit, which you'll see him do 
in televised tournaments. Any poker book in the world clearly 
puts a hand like that in the trash category, which means avoid 
it at all costs. 
Hopefully, after you finish reading this book, you'll have a 
better understanding of the theory behind playing trash hands 
from time to time, and when it might be right to do so. 
The basic principle behind playing a trash hand isn't that 
you believe your hand has any value at all. It's based on two 
things: 
1. You're representing a strong hand by bluffing. 
2. You're hoping your opponents don't have much of a hand. 
Let's say, for example, you're playing seven-card stud in an 
eight-man game and the first four players all fold to you. Your 
upcard is an ace. Unfortunately, for you, your hole cards are 
absolute trash (7-2). 
76 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
This isn't a hand you would play under any normal 
circumstances, but suppose that the three players remaining 
are all pretty tight. On top of that, their cards don't look 
threatening; player A shows a 2, player B has a 3, and player C 
also shows a deuce. 
What should you do? Raise! 
Yes, I know that the books tell you to never play a hand 
like that, but in this situation you can represent strength with 
a raise. Your opponents appear weak and they don't know you 
have garbage in the hole, so chances are you'll win the hand 
right then and there. 
Let's look at another example; this one from a Texas 
hold'em game. Everyone has folded to you in last position, and 
you're dealt the worst hand in hold'em: 7-2 offsuit. Probably 
98 percent of the time I'd suggest folding this junk and waiting 
for a better situation. Unless, of course, you know that the two 
players in the blinds are conservative types who operate very 
predictably. 
In this case, you can raise with any two cards. Now, this is 
important because you won't be playing your hand, you'll be 
playing theirs. 
If you do raise, chances are the blinds will both fold. That 
would be the most desired result, but even if they don't, you 
aren't necessarily out of the hand. 
Suppose the big blind calls your raise and the flop comes 
A A 9*4 • . If the conservative player in the big blind doesn't 
have the ace, he'll probably check to you. Despite the fact that 
you have nothing at all, you should still bet on the flop. 
If your opponent calls the bet, or, worse, raises, then you'll 
abort mission. But what will happen more often than not is that 
he'll fold if he doesn't have the pair of aces. 
That's not the only way you can win the pot; you could hit 
the flop yourself. Sure, 7-2 is a really poor hand, and difficult 
77 
Gardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
to hit, but you might just get lucky and flop a pair, two pair, or 
even three of a kind. 
While playing trash hands isn't something you'll ever have 
to do, if you want to reach the next level of poker thinking, it's 
something you'll eventually have to try. So, go ahead and add 
this play to your arsenal. 
Most beginning players are focused on, "What do I have?" 
The next step from there is, "What does my opponent have?" 
The third step, and the one that helps explain why in the world 
Gus Hansen always seems to have a junk hand, is "What does 
my opponent think I have?" 
Gus is a brilliant poker professional and is fully aware that 
he's perceived as a garbage collector. Since he understands the 
way opponents view him, he takes full advantage of that and 
gets paid handsomely when he hits his strong hands. 
There is a method to this kind of perceived madness. Don't 
judge an opponent by the garbage he plays. Instead, focus on 
how he plays these trashy hands, and recycle that information 
for later in the game. 
78 
Calling with the Worse Hand 
Situations will sometimes arise at the poker table when you 
just know that your opponent has you beat, but you should still 
call anyway. A perfect example occurred at the 2006 National 
Heads-Up Poker Championship in a hand between me and my 
good friend, poker professional, Evelyn Ng. 
In the hand, Evelyn raised to $ 1,200 before the flop, and 
I called with JA9A. The flop came J * 4 v 3 * , and I checked. 
Evelyn bet $1,600. At that point, she was ahead in the match, 
and I only had $12,600 in chips left. 
Finally, after much thought, I decided to go all-in hoping 
that she couldn't beat my pair of jacks. She thought about 
calling for quite some time but eventually folded the 7 4 4 * . 
On the surface, it might seem like Evelyn made the right 
decision. After all, I had a pair of jacks and she only had a pair 
of fours. With poker, though, as I hope you'll learn from me, 
there is often more to it than hand strength alone. 
First, let's look at the odds of her hand against mine. 
Since she could catch a 4, a 7, or a diamond, to win the 
pot, her hand was actually the slight favorite at 51 percent. In 
79 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
fact, the only hands that she wouldn't be favored against would 
be two pair or three of a kind. Even against trip jacks, she 
would still win the pot almost 30 percent of the time. 
That's not the only thing she had to ponder. 
Evelyn was faced with a bet of $ 11,000, but with what was 
already put in before the flop, as well as the bet she made on the 
flop, she'd have to risk $11,000 to win $16,600. She was even 
money to win the pot, but the pot was laying her approximately 
3 to 2 odds ($ 16,600/$ 11,000). Also, she had to consider that 
this was an opportunity to end the match. 
It's important to note that certain draws are so powerful 
that they can actually be the favorite to win the pot. 
For example, if you hold 5V6V and the flop came 
6 * 7 * 8 * , you'd be the favorite to win the pot—even against 
pocket aces! In fact, you'd be a substantial favorite, improving 
to the winning hand about 64 percent of the time. 
There's a rule you can use to help figure out whether or not 
your drawing hand is a favorite against an opponent. 
The rule: With the turn and river cards yet to come, if there 
are thirteen cards that will improve your hand to the winner, 
then you're a very small underdog. If fourteen cards can make 
your hand, you'll be just about even money to win. 
Here's a hand example I recendy analyzed. 
Player A's cards: 
80 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
Player B's cards: 
Q 
A 
0 
I * 
* z 
The flop: 
Q * 
* 
0 
* 
* e 
Player A had thirteen cards to improve his hand (eight 
clubs, two sevens, and three eights). His hand will win the pot 
47 percent of the time. 
Now, change the card in Player B's hand from the 2 * to 
the 2 V, and Player A actually goes from an underdog to a very 
slight favorite, winning the pot 50.1 percent of the time. Even 
more enticing, in a hand where Player A has fifteen outs, he'd 
be more than a 56 percent favorite. 
You don't need a PhD in mathematics to play poker, but it 
will serve you well to remember these odds. 
This knowledge becomes increasingly important when 
playing in no-limit hold'em tournaments. An extreme example 
would be a situation where a player has gone all-in, and you're 
the big blind with a pitiful hand like 3-2 offsuit. 
You know for certain that your opponent has you beat, 
but that doesn't necessarily mean that you should fold. First, 
calculate the pot odds you're getting. Then, assess your chances 
of winning by counting your outs. 
Here's a final example: You have $400 in the big blind, and 
an opponent goes all-in for $700. So, the bet facing you is only 
$300 more. Including the small blind, you'd be risking $300 to 
81 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
win $1,300. That's over 4 to 1 pot odds and is very favorable. 
Even if your opponent has a powerful hand like A-K, you'd still 
get lucky and win the pot 34 percent of the time. 
You won't win at poker by simply playing good hands. In 
order to reach that next level, you need to change the way you 
think about the game. Don't always be concerned with whether 
or not you have the best hand. Instead, focus on whether or not 
the pot odds dictate that you should play the hand. 
82 
Dangerous Hands to Play, Dangerous Hands to Own 
Danger is all around you at the poker table. 
The trick to becoming a successful poker player is learning 
how to avoid these dangerous traps, while striking fear into 
your opponents by playing some tricky hands. 
Dangerous Hands to Play 
The worst type of hand you can be dealt when playing 
Texas hold'em is one that seems to be too good to fold, but 
isn't good enough to raise with. Sure, it's easy to know that you 
should raise with pocket aces and fold a 7-2 offsuit, but hands 
like K-J offsuit can often cause you real problems. 
While it's obvious that high cards are better than low cards, 
in most no-limit hold'em situations, the little cards often have a 
better risk/reward ratio. 
The potential problem with trouble hands like K-J, A-J, 
QjJ, or even K-Q, is that when you flop a pair with them you'll 
often have kicker trouble. Too often, when you call a raise with 
a hand like K-Q,you'll be up against A-K, or maybe even A-A 
or K-K. 
83 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
If you're in there with K-Q^ and the flop comes 
Q-6-2, you'll have what appears to be a really strong hand. The 
problem, though, is that if someone decides to play against you 
after the flop, there is a good chance you're going to get beat. 
The bottom line is clear: If you were to play a big pot 
on that flop, for all of your money, chances are that you are 
walking into a set (trip deuces, sixes, or queens), an A-Q_, a pair 
of kings, or a pair of aces. 
Generally speaking, these trouble hands often win small 
pots when no one else hits the flop, and lose monster pots when 
they run into a better hand. Why? Because it's really difficult to 
fold such a seemingly strong hand after a flop like that. 
Now don't get me wrong. I'm not recommending that 
you never play a hand like K-Q^or A-J, but always remember, 
that when you do, you need to proceed cautiously. Don't get 
married to your top pair if a quality opponent is pushing the 
betting hard. 
Dangerous Hands to Own 
Now, compare the previous examples to playing a hand 
like a pocket pair of fours. This hand is much easier to work 
with. Either you hit the flop big, by landing three of a kind, or 
you have a hand with very little value. 
Let's look at another example. You call a raise with 4-4 
from late position, from a player who you suspect has a strong 
hand, maybe even A-A. You aren't calling because you think 
your little pair is the best hand, but you are doing so because of 
the potential to win a big pot. 
Let's say the flop now comes J * 4 * 2 • . Or, in other words, 
Gin baby! 
If your opponent did in fact start with a hand like A-A, K-
K, or Oj-0_, chances are you'll be able to win his whole stack if 
you bet it right. Had the flop come something like J-9-8, then 
you can safely fold your pair of fours without risking another 
84 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
chip. As you can see, it's a minor risk in relation to the big 
payday a small pair might offer you. 
There is one last group of hands that you might want to 
add to your repertoire—playing small-suited connectors like 
7-6. These hands can be a litde trickier than small pairs, but 
you'll be able to connect with them more often. The same 
principle holds true with these little cards as with the little pairs. 
Get to the flop cheaply if you can and get out if you don't 
improve. 
Let's look at one final example. You call a raise with 6-7 
of hearts and the flop comes 6-6-2. If your opponent has a big 
overpair, you might be able to win all of his chips, because he 
may not believe that you'd call a raise with a 6 in your hand. 
The key difference between dangerous hands to play and 
dangerous hands to own is that it's easy to get away from the 
latter, but it's often very difficult to avoid getting trapped with a 
risky hand like top pair. 
Be the dangerous player—not the player in danger. 
85 
Playing on a Short Stack 
When playing in a poker tournament you'll often find 
yourself in situations where you're short-stacked in relation to 
the blinds. This can happen for a number of reasons. Maybe 
you've lost a big hand, or perhaps the cards just haven't been 
coming for you. 
Whatever the cause, you have limited options, but you do 
have options. 
Too often I see players go all-in with garbage hands, 
essentially giving up, since they are short-stacked. Well, would 
you believe that World Series of Poker champion Jack Strauss, 
actually came back to win the main event after being down to 
just one measly chip? 
The old adage, "A chip and a chair," is a motto to live by. 
Rather than just giving up and throwing your chips in 
foolishly, here are some strategies to get you back into the game 
and on the right track when you're short-stacked. 
1. Wait for a decent hand. 
Now is not the time to try and see a lot of flops with weak 
86 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
hands. You need to look for a hand that plays well, hot and cold; 
meaning,, one that has a good chance of being the best hand 
before the flop. While hands like 6-5 suited are enticing, they 
obviously don't do very well hot and cold. However, hands like 
A-10 or K-Q, would have a very good chance to win if you 
were lucky enough to hit a pair. 
2. Go all-in. 
When you're short-stacked you have limited weapons, 
so when you do decide to play a hand, go all or nothing and 
bet everything you have left. If nobody calls, you'll win the 
blinds and antes which will help you claw your way back to 
respectability. In fact, when playing short-stacked, your goal 
should be to win those blinds and antes. 
3. Be the first player to enter the pot. 
- It's much better to be the first one into the pot when you 
play as a short stack. If someone has already raised in front of 
you, and then you go all-in, the chances that they'll call your 
bet increase. You simply wouldn't have enough chips to scare 
them off. 
Since your goal as a short stack is to attack the blinds and 
antes, logic dictates that if someone else has already shown 
interest in seeing the flop, it will be more difficult to get them 
to fold if you go all-in. 
4. Avoid the big stacks. 
Unless you have a premium starting hand, avoid going after 
the blind of a player who has a big stack of chips. He's more 
likely to defend his blind since your puny short stack won't do 
a lot of damage to him. Instead, you want to target other short 
stacks and average-sized stacks. Players with average stacks 
can't be as careless with their chips, so it will be easier to take 
their blinds. 
87 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
5. Don't give up. 
Just remember Jack Strauss. He became a World Champion 
when it looked like there was no way he could win another 
hand let alone the whole championship. 
You have to stay positive, dig deep and try to claw your way 
back into the tournament. Too many players give up, inevitably 
saying something like, "I didn't have a choice. I had no chips 
anyway." 
Well, you always have a choice, and the decisions you 
make as a short stack aren't insignificant at all. In fact, they are 
critical. 
Here are a couple of final thoughts, on the topic. 
It's important to figure out just how short your stack is. If 
your stack is just below average and the blinds are relatively 
small, there is no real need for drastic adjustments to your 
strategy. However, if you find yourself with just one big blind 
left, you can't afford to wait too long for a hand to play. You'll 
have to lower your starting hand requirements significantly and 
hope for the best. 
The last thing you want to do is ante yourself to death. 
When your stack becomes excessively short, hands like Q_-7 
suited or A-5 offsuit are clearly playable. Go ahead and toss all 
of your remaining chips into the pot. 
And keep your fingers crossed. 
88 
Controlling the Table with a Big Stack 
There is nothing more exciting than having a monster-
sized stack in a no-limit hold'em tournament. With a big pile 
of chips, there are so many ways you can use them to gather 
even more. Sheer brute aggression is one, but that approach 
can also jeopardize your stack if you aren't being careful. 
You see, while you want to use a big stack to bully the 
table, it's equally important to protect your chips so that you 
can continue to be the dominant force. If you're reckless with 
your chips and lose a big pot, it will greauy limit the weapons 
that you have in your arsenal. 
Here are six things to think about the next time you're 
sitting on a big stack in a tournament. 
1. Attack the short stacks. 
When players are down to very few chips, their options are 
severely limited. They're forced to wait for any decent hand 
and then move all-in. 
In the meantime, push them around with your big stack, 
89 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
since, even if they do play with you, the damage to your chip 
fortress would be minimal. 
When there are short stacks in the blinds, be very aggressive 
and raise with a wide variety of hands. Understand, it's not 
really all that important how strong your cards are. What 
matters is whether or not your opponents can find a hand 
strong enough to stand up to yours. 
2. Avoid the big stacks. 
The last thing you want to do is tangle with another player 
who also has a monster stack, unless of course you have a 
premium hand. The targets that you should be bluffing at are 
the chip-challenged opponents that can't hurt you too badly. 
Remember, you always want to protect your big stack, so 
when you're up against a player that could cripple your stack, 
proceed with caution. Don't get involved unless you have a 
quality hand. 
3. Don't play big pots. 
One way to protect your stack is to avoid playing big pots 
in marginal situations. Your goal is to increase your chip count 
slowly by avoiding major risks. So, in situations where you 
aren't totally sure that you have the best hand, play cautiously. 
Continue to stay aggressive in small pots, but don't risk a large 
percentage of your chips unless you have the nuts or close to it. 
4. Be creative. 
One of the luxuries of having a big stack is that you 
can use every poker trick in the book: slowplaying, trapping, 
bluffing, semibluffing and a host of others. While you want 
to be aggressive throughout, having a big stack affords you 
opportunities to mix it up, try out new tactics, and play hands 
deceptively. 
When your opponents think they have you all figured 
90 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
out, it's time to throw them a curveball and play a hand in an 
uncharacteristic style. This will be great for your table image 
as it makes you an unpredictable player that is tough to put on 
a hand. 
5. Strike fear in your opponents. 
You want to be an imposing figure at the table when you're 
a big stack. Your opponents should fear you whether you're 
betting, sitting in the big blind or haven't even acted yet. When 
they're afraid to play with you, you'll control the table. 
6. Be a constant presence. 
Let opponents know that you're there to play, not to sit 
on your stack. Use your mouth, but don't be rude, cocky, or 
annoying. You need your competitors to believe that you are on 
a mission. That alone will make you a pain in everyone's side. 
Cultivate that relentlessly aggressive image and opponents will 
be convinced that you'll play that way all day long. If players 
fear you, they'll often throw away hands they might otherwise 
raise you with. 
Following these six strategy tips will help your stack grow 
higher and lead you to more final tables. 
91 
Playing Fast, Playing Slow 
When it comes to the concept of fastplaying versus slowplaying 
in poker, it really doesn't matter what specific game you're 
talking about. 
It is important, however, to understand that different forms 
of poker require unique approaches and strategies. So, while 
it might be correct to habitually slowplay in a game like seven-
card stud high-low, it might end up being a huge mistake in 
limit Texas hold'em. 
In fact, limit hold'em is the one game where being an all-
out, fast, aggressive maniac is most rewarded. On top of that, 
if you happen to be playing short-handed (six or less players), I'd 
suggest putting on your seatbelt! 
Limit hold'em simply isn't designed to reward slowplay. 
That's not to say you should never suck opponents into a pot, 
but the situations where it's correct to do so are rare. Since it's 
so easy for a marginal hand to be outdrawn in a limit game, it's 
important to bet and raise with these types of hands to narrow 
down the field and thus increase your chances of winning the 
pot. 
92 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
The only time you might want to slowplay in limit hold'em 
is when you have an almost unbeatable hand and you feel as 
though betting will scare opponents away. For example, you 
have AV7V and the flop comes KV6V3V. This is a decent 
time to slowplay your hand, as it's highly unlikely that someone 
will beat you on the turn or river. 
The best limit hold'em players all have one thing in 
common; they pound, pound and pound, keeping it in high 
gear, fastplaying most of the way. Follow their lead and play 
your hands fast and aggressive. 
While limit poker is a game of brute force, no-limit requires 
more finesse, trapping skills and creativity. No-limit rewards 
players like two-time World Champion Johnny Chan, who 
uses sly betting patterns to feign weakness, trap opponents, and 
break them before they even know what hit them. 
It's no coincidence that Chan earned the nickname, "The 
Oriental Sand Trap." Johnny is a master of using slowplay. That 
moniker is well represented in the film Rounders. In it, Johnny 
flops the nut straight against Erik Seidel, and then allows Seidel 
to hang himself without Chan ever making a bet. All he does 
is provide the rope. 
If you're considering adding slow play to your repertoire, 
there are a few simple rules you should follow. 
Find the right opponent. 
The best type of opponent to slowplay against is the one 
who plays very aggressively and bluffs a lot. The player that 
will see your check as a sign of weakness and will look to take 
the pot away from you is a great target. Slowplaying against a 
timid player is much less effective. 
Have a monster hand. 
In order to justify slowplaying, you must hold a very strong 
hand. One pair, even if it's A-A or K-K, is still a marginal hand 
93 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
after the flop is dealt. Slowplay a hand like that and you'll often 
find that you're only trapping yourself into losing a monster 
pot. 
Have a plan. 
Don't just automatically slowplay a nut flush on the flop 
for the sake of using the ploy. Always think about how to 
maximize your profit in the hand, too. So, depending on the 
table action, don't count out fastplaying the nuts on the flop. 
In the right situation, fastplay might garner even more action 
than slowplay. 
Avoid predictability. 
If you always slowplay with monster hands, opponents will 
quickly notice, and your plan will be foiled. Be conscious of the 
fact that you must mix it up. Sometimes bet the flop when you 
have a full house; other times, check, looking for the slowplay 
opportunity. 
Also remember this: Never underestimate how perceptive 
your opponents are. They're always trying to figure you out, so 
don't make it easy on them. 
Mixing up fastplay and slowplay will keep the guessers 
guessing. 
94 
Three Dangerous Flops 
Most of the difficult decisions you'll face in a typical Texas 
hold'em poker hand will come after the flop. It's easy enough 
to figure out what a good hand is before the flop, and how you 
should play it, but there are many more variables to consider 
after the flop. Once those three community cards are dealt, 
many more possibilities exist. 
Here are three particularly dangerous flops along with 
some advice on how you should proceed. 
The Paired Flop 
A paired flop can either be a really good discovery for you, 
or the flop of death. Let's say you start with a pair of kings, and 
the flop comes Q y 7 * 7 * . In this situation you have two pair, 
kings and sevens. 
Obviously, if nobody has a 7 in their hand, you are in 
excellent shape (unless one of your opponents started with 
pocket queens or pocket aces). Since there are no draws on the 
board, it appears to be a pretty straightforward situation. 
But what if someone raises you? 
95 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
Your beautiful pair of kings might be up against a hand 
like A-Q. Or, you could easily be drawing to one of only two 
remaining kings left in the deck in the event that your opponent 
has the trip sevens. 
The best way to approach a flop like this with an overpair 
is to go ahead and bet, but if you receive any resistance, 
proceed with caution. Don't go crazy by raising and reraising. 
Be content to just call the hand down and hope your opponent 
has queens rather than the dreaded three sevens. 
The Coordinated Flop 
A coordinated flop is one where there is a three card 
straight present, something like Q-10-8. Let's say you hold 
a pair of aces, and there are three callers. A flop like that is 
extremely dangerous since it hits a range of cards with which 
your opponents might call. Hands like QJ, Q,-10, J-9, 8-8 are 
all cards that your competitors could feasibly be holding. 
While three out of the four hands already have your aces 
beat (two pair, a straight, and three of a kind), even the first 
hand, QJ, isn't too far behind your pocket bullets. If a 9, J or 
Q_ arrives on the turn or river, he'll beat you too. In fact, your 
aces are only a 2 to 1 favorite over the Q J on that flop. 
The more players that are in the pot, preflop, the more 
often a big pair ends up as a loser. The goal is to try narrowing 
the field by raising aggressively on the flop and then, if the 
turn card is a bad one (8, 9, 10, J, Q,, K), it's time to play very 
cautiously, even if that means folding. 
The Flushed Flop 
When the flop comes with three of the same suit, playing an 
overpair, without holding one of the suit, can be very tricky. 
Let's say you start with J*J<k, and the flop is 8v6*2V. 
While you do have a nice overpair, one more heart on the turn 
and your strong pocket jacks will likely be meaningless. 
96 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
The best way to approach a hand like this is to bet the flop, 
but don't get too aggressive by raising. You could, of course, 
raise all you want on the flop, but if someone has a heart in 
their hand, chances are he's going to call you anyway. 
You need to understand that it's better to play cautiously 
on the flop, since there are still two cards to come. If a safe card 
comes on the turn, that's when you might want to punish your 
opponent who is drawing to a flush. 
Now, if there are several players in the pot, you might even 
be better off folding right away on the flop. With six callers 
before the flop, it stands to reason that there is a decent chance 
one of your opponents may have hit their flush on the flop. If 
it's bet and raised in front of you, I would definitely suggest 
folding.

Don't Get Married to Your Aces 
When playing Texas hold'em there is nothing sweeter than 
looking down at a beautiful pair of rockets, bullets, American 
Airlines, the nuts, or whatever you want to call a pocket pair 
of aces. 
Just be careful with them. 
While they're definitely the best starting hand you can get, 
they could come with significant problems, especially if you 
fall deeply in love with them, and especially in no-limit Texas 
hold'em. 
Here's the problem. Many players have a tough time 
believing that pocket aces could ever lose. It happens, all right, 
happens to everybody. In fact, even 7-2 offsuit will beat aces 
about 12.5 percent of the time. 
The scariest bullet busters are suited connectors and small 
pairs. A hand like 7-6 suited will beat aces an astounding 23 
percent of the time, while a lowly pair of deuces will crack aces 
about 13.5 percent of the time. Though 13.5 percent may not 
seem like all that much, it ends up becoming very significant 
when you add betting to the mix. 
98 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
Let's say, for example, you raise before the flop with your 
aces, and your opponent calls you with 2-2. If the flop comes 
a rainbow J-6-2, that is, cards of all different suits, your pair 
of aces are in for some big trouble. It's tough to just throw the 
hand away on such a ragged flop, which is exactly what makes 
playing a hand like wired deuces so alluring for an opponent. 
The 2-2 is so much easier to play. If you don't catch a third 
deuce on the flop, you can simply dump your hand and wait for 
the next opportunity. 
That's not nearly as easy to do that when you have A-A. 
No-limit Texas hold'em specifically is a game of implied 
odds, meaning that you are looking to make small investments 
early in the hand in the hopes that it will pay off big time later 
on. 
Similar to buying blue chip stocks on Wall Street, pocket 
aces are a solid bet. But keep in mind that the stock market can 
tank at any moment, just like your pair of aces. 
Compare that to the 2-2, a penny stock hand, where your 
modest investment with marginal risk might end up as a home 
run. 
The truly great players recognize the problem with playing 
big pairs like A-A, K-K, and Q-Q_ and make the necessary 
adjustments. Rather than over value their big pairs, they 
proceed cautiously in the face of danger. 
If, for example, a flop comes 6-7-8 and he has A-A, a top 
player wouldn't be so quick to go all-in, fearing a possible 
straight, trips, or even two pair. He may choose to just call an 
opponent's bet. If the heat becomes too strong, he'd seriously 
consider folding the hand to avoid a situation where he may 
have been doomed to go broke. 
A novice player might complain about his bad luck 
when his pocket aces lose to an opponent who played 10-9. 
Oftentimes, it wasn't the rookie's luck that lost him all of his 
99 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
money. It was his inability to recognize the danger in that flop 
and the potential for losing all of his chips. 
Take this lesson to heart and your playing strategy is 
born. 
If you face an opponent who isn't capable of folding big 
pairs after the flop, it makes sense to play him with weaker 
hands. Even though you are fully aware that he likely has a 
premium hand, it's still a solid play. 
In fact, with a hand like 3-3, 4-4, or 6-5 suited, that's 
precisely what you want him to have. That way, if you are lucky 
enough to hit a monster flop, you'll have that poor sucker on 
the ropes, desperately hoping for a miracle ace to save him. 
That's exactly what great players will attempt to do against 
a novice. They'll try to make a small investment with some off-
the-wall hands hoping to catch a big flop and take the rookie 
for all of his chips. 
When you see someone like Gus Hansen playing on 
television, or myself for that matter, playing all kinds of hands 
that you aren't supposed to play, remember that there is method 
to the madness. 
We just happen to like gambling on penny stocks with big 
upside potential.

Where To Sit at the Poker Table? 
While this may seem rather silly to some, there is actually 
merit to the question, "Where is the best place to sit at a poker 
table?" 
No, I'm not talking about closest to the bathroom or to the 
fridge. I'm talking about where the best place is for you to sit at 
the poker table in relation to certain types of players. 
If you've played poker at all, you know that people approach 
the game in different ways—some by the seat of their pants, 
others very carefully. You have experienced players and novices, 
aggressive types and conservative competitors. Eventually 
you'll meet them all at the poker table, and knowing which seat 
offers you the best chance for winning against whoever you 
might face can only improve your game. 
There is a general rule when picking your seat that you 
should always abide by. You want the most difficult players on 
your right. Here's where you should try to be for each type of 
player. 
101 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
1. Conservative or tight players. 
These rocks are no real threat to you, so, abiding by the 
general rule, you shouldn't really care all that much where they 
sit. Ideally, though, you'd want these players to your left so that 
you can pick on their blinds. If they happen to play with you 
when you've entered the pot, you can be sure they have a strong 
hand. Act accordingly. That wouldn't always be true with the 
next group of players. 
2. Aggressive players. 
These are the players that you need to worry about. 
An aggressive player on your left means you're somewhat 
handcuffed. You have to play a little more conservatively now 
because having that monster behind you means you don't know 
what he'll do until after you've acted. 
You'll always prefer the aggressive players on your right so 
that you can keep an eye on them and then spank them when 
they get out of line! Basically, you'll be able to use your position 
to exploit the aggressive player. 
If you have a seating choice, when facing both an aggressive 
and a conservative player, sit right between them with the 
tighter player on your left. 
Things get a bit trickier when you're figuring out where to 
sit when playing either a novice or an experienced player, since 
you'll want both of them on your right to some degree. 
3. Novice players. 
If you are playing with a rookie, chances are he's going to 
make a lot of mistakes, and you want to be in there when he 
does. So by sitting on his left you'll have the opportunity to see 
whether or not he enters the pot. Since you'll have position on 
him you can manipulate the novice much easier and force him 
into even more mistakes. 
According to the general rule, you'll want players you 
102 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
worry about on your right, but in this case you aren't worried 
about the novice since you can control or exploit him better if 
you sit on his left. 
4. Experienced players. 
Well this obviously depends on how good the experienced 
players are, but generally these competitors surprise you less often 
than a novice player. They will most likely play fundamentally 
sound, which, while more predictable, doesn't necessarily make 
it easier for you. You'll want a tough, aggressive experienced 
player sitting on your right. But against a more conservative 
experienced player, you'd prefer him on your left rather than 
the easily exploitable novice. 
You're not always going to be able to pick your seat, 
especially in a tournament, so it's important to know how to 
play against both novice and aggressive opponents when they 
are seated to your left. 
When the novice is on your left, all that really means is 
you'll have less opportunities to exploit him, but you don't need 
to make any major strategy adjustments. 
With the aggressive player on your left, however, you need 
to make significant strategy adjustments. You really need to 
respect the fact that position is power, and since this competitor 
has it, you must concede your relative weakness a litde bit and 
play accordingly. 
From time to time, look to set traps for the aggressive 
player by slowplaying strong hands. This should help keep him 
from breathing down your neck on a regular basis. Other than 
that, just tighten up a litde bit and wait for a better situation to 
arise—like maybe, switching seats! 
103 
The Check-Raise 
Whether you're playing limit hold'em, seven-card stud, 
Omaha, or even no-limit hold'em, the check-raise can be a 
deadly weapon when used properly. 
Check-raising, in a nutshell, is a play in which you pass 
your turn by not betting. That's the check, and it should suggest, 
since you didn't want to bet, that you don't have a strong hand. 
Once you check, and another player bets, you pounce out of 
the high grass with the raise. 
It's obviously a powerful tool and sometimes a controversial 
one. 
In some home games, the check-raise is outlawed entirely 
because of its deceptive nature. Come on now, we're playing 
poker here! 
While the play has always had a negative connotation 
attached to it, I'm here to tell you that the check-raise is your 
friend. 
There should never be rules that suggest you can't bluff 
or use deception to maximize your profit. It's all part of the 
game. If you and your friends play with a no check-raising rule, 
104 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
all you're doing is making the game less interesting and more 
robotic. 
The key thing about the check-raise is that it helps to 
neutralize a positional disadvantage. While you should 
understand that it's better to act last, the check-raise is a weapon 
that can help an out-of-position player defend himself. 
Let's say, for example, that you're playing in a no-limit 
game where check-raising isn't allowed. You find yourself 
heads-up against an opponent on the river and check to him. 
Obviously, your opponent is in a very powerful position. He 
can bet whatever amount he wants without fear of a check-
raise. That puts you, the out-of-position player, at an unfair 
disadvantage. 
Now, suppose you're in the exact same situation, but this 
time check-raising is allowed. Once you check on the river, your 
opponent now must think twice about betting a marginal hand. 
He'd have to ask himself, "Is he playing possum and waiting to 
check-raise me?" 
Adding that element of fear helps shift a degree of power 
back to the player sitting out of position. It's still much better 
to be in position, mind you, but with the check-raise option 
available, it makes it a much more level playing field. 
The check-raise is especially effective against aggressive 
opponents who often bet when someone shows weakness by 
checking. An aggressive player always looks to steal pots; so, 
by checking to him, you let him bluff off his money before 
smacking him back with a raise. 
Here are six ways the check-raise will help you to improve 
your game: 
1. It neutralizes the positional disadvantage. 
Without the use of the check-raise, you're forced to play 
even more conservatively when out of position. 
105 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
2. It allows you to trap aggressive opponents for extra 
bets. 
Against aggressive competitors, you'll often be able to win 
extra bets when they try to steal the pot after you've checked. 
3. It adds deception to your game. 
Check-raising is an excellent way to mix up your game and 
become less predictable. Sometimes you'll check with a strong 
hand, while other times you'll bet right out. The check-raise, or 
lack of it, will keep them guessing. 
4. It makes your opponents think twice about betting 
after you've checked. 
Once your opponents know that you're capable of raising 
after you've checked, it will often fool them into checking the 
best hand behind you, which often earns you a valuable free 
card. 
5. It helps you to knock players out of the pot. 
In situations where you want to narrow down the field, a 
check-raise can help you force an opponent to fold a hand that 
he'd likely call for one bet, but would fold for two bets. 
6. It gives you another bluffing option. 
Since the check-raise is often seen as a powerful ploy played 
with a powerful hand, you can also use it as a sophisticated 
bluff against thinking opponents. 
The check-raise just makes poker more fun. So don't take 
it personally when a friend traps you with a check-raise. It's all 
part of the game.

TflWe Position 
People often ask me the question, "How do you play K-J 
offsuit?" My answer is always the same: "It depends." 
The most important consideration when deciding how to 
play any poker hand, aside from the strength of the hand, is 
your position at the table. 
Position can be broken down into three categories: early, 
middle, and late. At a nine-handed table, the first three seats to 
the left of the button are considered early position. The next 
three are middle position, and the last two seats, as well as 
the player on the dealer button, are late position. 
The absolute best position to enter a pot from is that final 
dealer spot. When you play a hand from the button you have 
the advantage of seeing all of your opponents' actions before 
deciding what you want to do, and you get to keep that deadly 
weapon throughout the entire hand. 
How cool is that? 
Now just for a second let's pretend that you aren't playing 
poker, but instead you're seated at a blackjack table. In blackjack, 
107 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
the dealer immediately has a huge advantage because you have 
to act, hit or stand, before he does. 
Let's say you're dealt 7-6 for a 13 and the dealer is showing 
an 8. Well, any book will tell you that you need to hit on a 13 
against an 8. So you tap the table and ask for a card and it's a 
big fat king. Busted! 
The dealer then turns over his concealed card and reveals 
a 5, meaning that he started with the same 13 that you did. 
One big difference is that the dealer didn't have to run the 
gauntlet and risk busting like you just did. Add to that the fact 
that if your 13 improved to a 17 the dealer would still have an 
opportunity to beat you if he drew a 5, 6, 7, or an 8. 
Okay, so why am I discussing blackjack in a poker book? 
It's because similar principles hold true when factoring in 
your position at the poker table. In Texas hold'em, the most 
popular form of poker in the world, you must remember that 
your two-card starting hand will miss the flop more often than 
it will hit. There are going to be many situations where the pot 
is up for grabs, and the first person to bet at it will likely pick 
it up. 
Having position in these types of situations is a great 
benefit. 
Let's say you have one other player in the pot with you, and 
you have that precious dealer button. The flop comes A*J>4> 
and your hand is 10V8V. 
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the flop 
completely missed your hand. Since we know that more often 
than not the flop will miss your opponent's hand, too, you may 
still be able to pick up this pot because you are in the power 
position. 
If your opponent checks on the flop, you can simply bet 
right there as a bluff. If he doesn't have the ace, and has any 
poker sense at all, he'll fold his hand—making you the winner. 
Now if your opponent bets right out on the flop, you 
108 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
can safely fold your hand and save the bluff bet you were 
planning. 
The only real equalizer to someone having position on 
you is the deadly check-raise. Using this tactic, an opponent 
checks to you with a strong hand, trying to conceal it, and then 
pounces on your bet with a big raise. It's never a good feeling 
when that situation occurs, but it happens to everyone sooner 
or later. 
While the check-raise play definitely offsets some of the 
button's edge, it's also very risky and can be expensive. For a 
check-raise to work, you have to know, or have a very strong 
suspicion, that your opponent, will, in fact bet if you check. If 
he doesn't bet, then you've just given him a free card that might 
just cost you the pot. 
So knowing how important position is to your overall 
success, it makes sense to play more conservatively when 
seated in an early position and more aggressively when in a 
late position. And if you decide to play a hand from an early 
position, it had better be a premium hand. 
On the button? That's where you can really be creative, 
stretch your starting hand requirements, and play with power. 
109 
Limit Hold'em Tactics in No-Limit Hold'em Games 
Don't be a one-trick pony. Learning how to play more than 
just no-limit Texas hold'em will actually make you a better 
overall poker player, and, ironically, will make you a better no-
limit hold'em player as well. 
Limit and no-limit hold'em are played very differently, 
but that doesn't mean that you can't use some limit tactics 
in no-limit. In fact, there are several poker weapons that 
are considered limit plays, but when used correctly are very 
effective in the game of no-limit. 
Let's look at two of these plays and how they relate to each 
game. 
Betting the flop 
In limit hold'em, it's common practice for a player who 
raises before the flop to bet at least once more on the flop. 
The goal is to quickly pick up the pot in the hope that your 
opponents miss with the first community cards. 
Well, this is also an effective weapon in no-limit hold'em. 
However, there are a few important differences. 
110 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
Betting the flop in no-limit will win you the pot more often, 
but you'll usually be risking more money. Because limit betting 
is structured, in a $10/$20 limit hold'em game, it will only cost 
you $10 to try and steal the pot. If the bet doesn't work, the 
damage is minimal. 
In no-limit, though, the pain could be much more severe. 
' Since you can bet all of your chips at any time, you're also 
risking your entire stack if you push it all-in on the wrong 
flop. 
To avoid that catastrophe, take a lesson from successful 
limit players. 
Rather than bet the whole pot in a no-limit game, bet 
anywhere from one-third to one-half of the pot. A bet of half 
the pot will generally have the same effect as a pot-sized bet, 
and it will cost you much less if the bluff doesn't work. 
Three-betting before the flop 
When you watch high-stakes limit hold'em poker, you'll 
often see a preflop raise, followed by a reraise. Then, the pot is 
generally played heads-up, with the player who put in the last 
raise before the flop taking the lead. 
This gives the three-bettor control of the hand and allows 
him to represent strength. If his opponent misses the flop, the 
aggressor can often take the pot away with another bet on the 
flop. This tactic works even better when the aggressor also has 
position. 
Here's an example of how this might work in limit 
hold'em. 
Player A raises with 7-7, and Player B decides to reraise 
from the button with 5-5. The flop comes A-K-9. Player A 
checks. Player B bets with position. Now, all Player A can do is 
' fold due to the scary board, thus allowing Player B to win the 
pot with a weaker hand. 
Ill 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
This play works well in no-limit hold'em, too, albeit in a 
very different form. 
When a player makes it three bets in limit hold'em, the first 
raiser will always call one more bet to see the flop. That's not 
true in no-limit. 
You can raise more than just one bet in no-limit, so you can 
actually force your opponent to fold before the flop. 
Let's look at another example, but now in a no-limit 
game. 
The blinds are $10/$20, and Player A raises to $60 with 
pocket sevens. This time, Player B, sitting on the button with A-
K, reraises to $200. Player A now has a very difficult decision 
to make. If he decides to call and see the flop, he'll likely fold to 
another forceful bet unless he catches his third seven. 
If the flop comes something like Q;10-4, Player A will 
check, and player B might bet, say, $300. There is almost no 
way that Player A can call that bet. 
The key difference between limit and no-limit hold'em is 
the level of aggressive play employed on the flop. 
Because it's far riskier to bet after the flop, no-limit players 
tend to play the board more carefully. By so doing, they're 
essentially giving up on pots that they could often win with a 
bet. 
So, as if you were playing in a limit game, keep your no-
limit pots small by lowering your bet sizes. This will reduce 
the risk associated with playing the perilous game of no-limit 
hold'em. 
112 
Setting Up a Bluff 
One of the biggest mistakes I see novice players make is 
that they bluff in situations when it couldn't possibly work. 
I cannot tell you how many times I've heard this excuse: 
"Well I had to try. I couldn't win if I didn't try to bluff." To that 
I say, "Did you ever think that maybe you couldn't have won 
anyway?" 
Wasted, desperation bluffs will drain your bankroll faster 
than Dracula would necks at a blood drive. 
There is an easy solution—to the poker problem, anyway. 
You have to set up a bluff by thoroughly thinking it through 
early in the hand. Playing an effective bluff is similar to telling 
an elaborate lie. 
For example, let's say you call your boss to let him know 
you can't come to work because you're in bed with the flu. But, 
in fact, you aren't home at all and are calling him from your 
swanky hotel room in Vegas. 
The first thing your boss is going to look for is a hole in 
your story. In this case, when his caller ID comes up with the 
702 area code, how are you going to explain that one? 
113 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
"I thought you were sick in bed with the flu? What's up 
with the 702 area code?" 
Your response would undoubtedly be something lame, like, 
"Errr, umm. I dunno." 
Your bluff didn't make sense because you didn't set it up 
right. The supposed fact you presented in your story didn't 
make any sense at all. You needed to tell a more believable 
story and back it up with some action that didn't contradict 
what you were saying—like *69ing yourself to block your caller 
ID! 
Okay then, let's take a look at how all of this bluffing relates 
to playing a hand of poker. 
In a $5/$10 Texas hold'em game, holding I O V J V , you 
raise before the flop, and one player calls your bet. The flop 
comes K * 9 v 4 * , and you bet $5 with your flush and straight 
draw. Your opponent raises you another $5 and you call. 
The turn card is the 7 • and you check to your opponent 
who bets $10. You, of course, call the bet. Now the river card 
comes 2*, or in poker terms—a big fat brick! 
This is simply not the time or place to attempt a bluff. 
You certainly can't win if you check, but what I'm trying 
to explain is that you aren't going to win if you bet, either. 
Your bet would make no sense. It would be a meaningless bluff. 
Don't do it. 
Ask yourself this question: What junk am I trying to peddle 
by betting when the 2 * comes on the river? 
If your opponent has anything at all, he is going to call your 
bluff in a heartbeat. Because you played the hand so cautiously 
up until the river card, it's now too late to try and represent 
a strong hand. The only story you've told with your betting 
action is that you don't have a very good hand. 
So how do you make a bluff work? 
It's critical that you set up the bluff early in the hand. Play it 
from the start in such a way that your opponents might actually 
114 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
think you have very strong cards. In the preceding scenario, 
there would have been several ways to do that: 
1. Re-raise the bet on the flop. 
2. Check-raise the bet on the flop. 
3. Check-raise the bet on the turn. 
Had you acted in any of these ways, and took control of 
the hand early, your river bet would have looked like it made 
sense. 
One of the great things about poker is that there are so 
many variables and so many ways to play different situations. If 
you choose to play a bluff, great, just set it up from the start. 
Just as importantly, eliminate those desperate river card bluffs 
and you'll erase a huge weakness in your game. 
115 
The Top 10 Myths About Poker 
When you've been around poker for as long as I have, 
you've heard every theory, rumor, and falsehood about the 
game. Poker is indeed full of myths, and here are some of the 
big ones. 
1. Poker is illegal. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the U.S. 
government recognizes poker as a game of skill. Yes, there 
might be jurisdictions where playing poker for money is illegal, 
but there is nothing at all illegal about playing poker with 
friends, or even playing poker for a living. 
2. It takes several years to learn. 
It's not true, at least not anymore. Today, thanks to people 
like Doyle Brunson, who wrote Super System, it's easier than ever 
to learn how to play poker at a competitive level. There are 
also numerous books, software, DVDs, and other teaching tools 
available. 
116 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
3. Poker is all about bluffing. 
No, it's not. In fact, that's one of the big mistakes novice 
players make when they start out in poker. Professionals win by 
getting full value for their strong hands, while minimizing their 
losses on losing hands. Bluffing is a tool that should be used 
sporadically, making it that much more effective. 
4. It's a man's game. 
Hardly. We are seeing more and more women—amateurs 
and professionals alike—playing these days. One of the world's 
best players, Jennifer Harman, is a regular winner in the world's 
biggest cash game against the likes of poker professionals Chip 
Reese and Phil Ivey. 
5. Online poker is rigged. 
Some people have a tendency to blame anyone but 
themselves. Before the arrival of online poker, complainers 
blamed the casino dealer for their bad luck. Online poker has 
become the new victim of abuse from players who would rather 
blame their computer than their lack of poker skills. 
6. Poker is gambling and you have to gamble to make 
it fun. 
Too often, poker and gambling are considered to be 
synonymous. Yes, poker is a game and, yes, you can gamble at 
it. But you can also gamble on Monopoly, Hop Scotch, or even 
the flip of a coin. I know, because I've made wagers on all of 
the above! 
7. No-limit hold'em is the most skillful form of poker. 
There is actually a form of poker that requires even more 
skill: pot-limit hold'em. This game gives solid players a bigger 
advantage because it takes away the beginner's deadly all-in 
weapon. It also forces more sophisticated post-flop play. 
117 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
If pot-limit hold'em were the game played at the World 
Championships, you'd see less and less Cinderella stories at the 
final table. 
8. The game is all luck. 
People still believe this nonsense. This misconception 
comes from people who don't understand poker or haven't 
figured out how to win at it. 
There are thousands of skilled professional poker players 
in the world, which distinguishes poker from other forms of 
casino gambling, like craps, keno, and Let it Ride. I assure you, 
there are no professional Let it Ride players. 
9. You can't beat low limit games. 
I've met several people who feel they can't win at low limit 
tables because too many players see the flop and then stick 
around until the river. While a game like this will certainly 
increase your stack fluctuation, and might make you feel like 
you're less in control, there isn't a more profitable game in the 
house. 
If you're losing in lower limit games, playing higher limits 
is not the answer. 
10. You need a poker face. 
This one's probably the longest standing myth on the 
list. People commonly believe that you need a poker face to 
win. Well, watch me play on television and you'll see that I 
don't have a poker face at all. I'm generally joking around and 
making all kinds of goofy faces. 
118 
Playing the Player 
You'll often hear the expression, "playing the player," as 
it relates to poker. I want to share with you what it actually 
means, as well as give you some tips on how to do it. 
Legendary poker champion Doyle Brunson once said 
about a no-limit game he played in, "I could beat that game 
without even looking at my cards." He wasn't being cocky 
or disrespectful towards the other players. Doyle was just 
supremely confident in his ability to play the players. He could 
read them so well that the cards became irrelevant. 
Obviously, he couldn't win if his opponents knew that he 
wasn't looking at his hole cards, but if Doyle played his position 
properly, he felt like he could pull it off. 
How, you ask, can you win at no-limit Texas hold'em 
without looking at your cards? It's not easy, but let me give you 
a few key points to consider. 
Position 
Position is power. When it comes to playing your opponents, 
being able to see their actions before you act is a huge advantage. 
119 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
When they check, bet a little bit, or even overbet the pot. These 
actions will give you key information as to the strength of their 
hands. 
With some players a check means that they don't have 
anything at all. Others might have a telltale sign of overbetting 
the pot when they're bluffing. If you are in tune with your 
opponents' tendencies, you can use your position to steal pots 
from them. 
Reading Tells 
This part isn't easy, especially if you aren't adept at reading 
body language. However, this skill can be learned. 
Your brain really does process information like a computer. 
Just by being focused and paying attention, you'll pick up 
player information you don't even realize you're subconsciously 
acquiring. The next time you see an opponent betting his chips 
a certain way, your subconscious will send a message to the 
conscious part of the brain—something like "Suspicion alert! 
I've seen that somewhere before and it means he's bluffing!" 
When you talk to a player like Jennifer Harman, in my 
opinion, the best female poker player in the world, about why 
she made a certain call, she'll say something like, "I don't know. 
I just felt he was bluffing." 
Well the truth is, while Jennifer doesn't necessarily know 
why she made the call, it was no fluke. Her subconscious told 
her something was suspicious about the way her opponent bet 
his chips. 
If you're able to read body language tells that reveal the 
strength of your opponent's hand, it will make beating him so 
much easier. Imagine knowing that when he bets with his left 
hand he's bluffing, and when he bets with his right hand, he has 
a really strong hand. How could you ever lose? 
120 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
Scare Cards 
Doyle Brunson is a master at combining position and 
reading tells to determine the strength of his opponent's hand. 
Yet there is one more piece to the puzzle. Doyle can get inside 
his opponent's head and figure out what he's holding, and just 
as importantly, what he's not holding. I'll explain. 
If Doyle knows what type of hand a competitor is holding, 
he'll also be able to figure out what board cards will scare the 
opponent. 
Let's say, for example, Doyle calls a tight, conservative 
player who raised from early position. Doyle won't even have 
to look at his hole cards. Instead, he'll combine position, tells 
and the board cards to outplay his opponent. 
Okay, now the flop comes 8v9v7<fc, and Doyle's opponent 
bets the whole pot. Based on previous hands against this player, 
Doyle believes that his opponent has to have a hand like A-A, 
K-K, or QjCX So, without ever looking at his cards, he makes 
the call. 
Then the turn card comes 10 V. The opponent checks, and 
Doyle can now steal the pot by representing either the straight 
or the flush. His opponent can't call. 
That's just One example of how it's done. Keep in mind, 
however, that in order to be able to consistently outmaneuver 
your opponents, you need to have position, pay attention to 
their body language, and also be able to use scary board cards 
to your advantage. 
121 
Suited Connectors 
"Texas Dolly" Doyle Brunson changed the way poker 
would be played forever when he wrote Super System so many 
years ago. In that legendary bible of poker, Doyle introduced 
some new poker concepts that, until then, only he and a few 
other professional players truly understood. 
This specifically refers to one of those concepts: How 
and when to play suited connectors. Back in the days when 
Doyle was cleaning up with his aggressive style, most of the 
other players played close to the vest and waited for high card 
combinations like A-A, A-K, or K - Q 
Once Doyle understood that his opponents would never 
play so-called garbage hands like 6-7 suited, it became easier 
for him to read his rivals. He knew that little cards on the 
flop likely wouldn't help his opponents. He also knew that his 
opponents either started with a pair or that they likely had two 
high cards like Big Slick, A-K. With this information, Doyle 
cemented his reputation as one of the best who's ever played 
the game. 
So then, why would you want to play a suited connector 
122 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
hand like 7 * 8 * if you know that your opponents are starting 
with strong hands? 
Well, because in no-limit hold'em, it's not what you start 
with that counts, it's what you end up with. If you're holding 
small suited connectors, and for a relatively small percentage 
of your stack you can stay in to see the flop, there are several 
benefits: 
1. If you happen to get lucky with that 7 * 8 * and hit a flop 
like 4-5-6 or 8-7-3, you'll often trap an opponent with an 
overpair like A-A, K-K, or Q,-Q 
2. It adds unpredictability to your game. Playing cards at every 
end of the deck will make it much more difficult for your 
adversaries to get a read on you. 
3. Now here's the best part. You'll actually be able to bluff 
more! This may sound strange to you but think about it. If 
your opponents catch on to the fact that you play all sorts of 
junny cards, you'll be able to bluff them on the flop when you 
don't improve your hand. 
For example, if you played a hand like Q J suited, and the 
flop came 4-5-6, you could still win this pot. How? Well, your 
opponents may fear that you are playing the little cards again 
and flopped two pair or maybe even a straight. Even if they 
have Big Slick, there's a decent chance that they'll throw it in 
the muck making you the winner. 
Doyle also discussed the concept of limping in with 
suited connectors by just calling the big blind to see the 
flop cheaply. Unfortunately, once the book came out, better 
players recognized that those limp-ins usually signified a suited 
connector, sometimes a small pair, or, in rare cases, a strong 
hand like A-A or K-K looking to set a trap. 
So, my advice is to take your game one deceptive step 
123 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
further. If you're holding suited connectors, throw out some 
small raises from time to time. This way, people won't know if 
you have A-A, A-Q, or 6 • 8 • . Mixing up your play by throwing 
in the occasional raise with relatively weak suited connectors 
will go a long way toward making you a dangerous and tricky 
player. That's exactly the type of player that you want to be 
and that most people fear. 
When deciding if it makes sense to play suited connectors, 
there are several things you should think about: 
1. Your stack size. 
If you are on a short stack, you won't get the implied odds 
you would with a big stack. On a short stack you need to avoid 
these hands and look for cards that are higher in rank. 
2. The size of the bet. 
You can't call raises with suited connectors if the size of 
the bet is too big a percentage of your stack. Ideally, you want 
to invest only a small percentage of your stack when trying to 
hit a home run. 
3. If you don't hit the flop, well, abort mission! 
Don't get stubborn. These are tricky hands to play, and 
if you don't improve with a good flop, you need to dump the 
hand and move on. You'll get other chances later. 
When you see me playing poker on TV, you'll notice that 
I take my own advice. You'll often find me in there with some 
strange-looking hands, but, rest assured, there is method to my 
madness. Add some suited connectors to your repertoire from 
time to time, and you will see your overall results improve. 
That is a guarantee. 
124 
Heads-Up with Jerry Buss 
At the first-ever National Heads-Up Poker Championship, 
my first round opponent was none other than Los Angeles 
Lakers owner, Dr. Jerry Buss. Jerry was one of just a handful 
of celebrity players in a tough field of 64 that also included the 
likes of actor James Woods, and poker professionals Johnny 
Chan and Doyle Branson. 
Drawing Jerry in the first round was supposed to make it 
easy for me, but he is no slouch at the table, having played 
countless hours of high stakes poker against some of the 
world's best. 
If you caught that episode on television, you would have 
seen me make a miraculous prediction to finish off the match. 
Not only did I predict that precisely the 8 of diamonds would 
fall on the turn, but also that the last card would be the jack 
of diamonds, giving me a straight flush to beat Jerry's ace-high 
flush. 
How did I do it? 
I have absolutely no idea. The odds of calling two 
125 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
consecutive cards are astronomical, and I'll predict this too— 
I'll never do it again the rest of my life. 
As improbable as that was, it's not the hand I want to talk 
about. 
There was a crucial hand earlier in the match where I had 
a chance to knock Jerry out of the tournament. Instead, I threw 
the hand away. It's a laydown I might not have made in most 
situations because of the standardized rules in tournament 
play. 
All of the major tournaments in the United States share 
the following rule: You may not show your opponent your 
hand until the action is complete, or you will receive a penalty 
(usually 10 minutes on the sidelines while your chips are anted 
off). 
However, the rule for the Heads-Up Championship allowed 
a player to show his opponent a hand any time he wished. 
Why would anyone want to do that, you ask? Well, often 
you can pick up a tell on your opponent based on the way he 
reacts to seeing your hand. If you show him a better hand, for 
example, he may get nervous. Vice versa, if you show him a 
hand that he can beat, he may appear more relaxed. 
So I found myself in an interesting situation against Jerry 
when he bet all of his remaining chips on the river, with a final 
board of Q-10-3-A-9. Jerry had first checked, then called on 
the flop, and when the ace hit on the turn, we both checked. 
On the river, the 9 gave me two pair, queens and nines, and 
Jerry bet about $8,000. If I called with my two pair and won, 
it would be all over. If I called and lost, I'd be letting Jerry right 
back into a match that I was dominating at the time. 
So that's when I decided to take advantage of the "show 
your hand" rule and let Jerry take a look at my cards. 
Jerry glanced over at my two pair and genuinely didn't 
look worried. In fact, his reaction was one of relief more than 
anything. 
126 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
I started talking aloud as I often do while I play. 
"Jerry, what do you want me to do here?" Without much 
hesitation, Jerry replied, "Well, I'd like you to call, actually." 
I believed him. He even kind of smirked when he said it. 
There was so much evidence pointing toward Jerry having me 
beat. I couldn't ignore it. I folded the hand. 
One of Jerry's biggest strengths in life, but biggest 
weaknesses at the poker table, is that he is an honest man. 
Jerry wouldn't have been able to tell me an outright he like that 
without feeling guilty. He's too honest! 
I went on to win the match a few rounds later with my 
straight flush. 
That's when Jerry told me that he just had a pair of queens 
in the earlier hand—but, in fact, he didn't. 
"So you bluffed me then, Jerry? Nice play," I said. 
"No, I didn't bluff you. I had queens and tens," replied 
Buss. 
As I said, Jerry is an honest man. He lied to me for a split 
second and then immediately felt guilty and had to reveal the 
truth. And least I think he did. 
When I finally watched the broadcast at home, all of my 
suspicions were correct. Jerry had precisely queens and tens. 
The lesson in this story is that poker is more than just about 
the cards you are dealt. It's about people, understanding human 
nature, and basically learning what makes them tick. 
Unfortunately for Dr. Buss, I had him pegged as an honest 
guy and my read was dead on.

Why the House Always Wins 
Poker is very different from other casino games. 
The first thing you have to realize is that the gaming 
giants don't keep building luxurious casinos because gamblers 
consistendy win in Las Vegas. The house games are designed 
so that the casino always has an edge over the player. 
So face it, you'll never have an edge in casino games like 
roulette, craps and Let it Ride. Even in pai gow, where the 
odds are as close to 50-50 as you're going to get, the house still 
maintains an edge. 
Why? Well, every time you win you have to pay the house 
a 5 percent commission. That might not seem like much at the 
time, but those small edges are enough for Las Vegas to make 
billions off tourists with dreams of hitting it big. 
So what makes poker any different? 
The casino has no vested interest in who wins or loses. 
You aren't playing against the house. Instead, you're basically 
renting a seat from them. 
Poker players should look at the house more like a landlord 
than as an adversary. Depending on the casino, your rent comes 
in one of two forms: either a rake, or what's called, a collection. 
128 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
In a raked game, the house takes a percentage of the pot 
each hand. A typical rake in a $5/$ 10 limit hold'em game will 
be something like 5 percent, up to a $3 maximum. If the total 
size of the pot is $20, the house will rake $1. If the pot is $60 or 
more, the house will still take the maximum rake of $3. 
In higher limit games, however, the house charges a 
collection. This means that every half hour they'll require 
a certain amount from each player. In a $10/$20 game, the 
collection might be something like $5 per player, per half 
hour. 
There are some minor strategic adjustments you should 
make depending on whether or not the house is taking a rake 
or charging a collection. You see, in a collection game, it doesn't 
matter how many small pots you win, as you'll be paying the 
house a set amount every thirty minutes. 
In a raked game, though, the more pots you win the more 
you are essentially paying for your seat. So speaking very 
generally, you should play slightly more conservatively in a 
raked game and more aggressively in a collection game. 
Also, look to get involved in multiway pots with lots of 
value. If you're playing in a tight, raked game, many of the 
hands you play will be heads-up or three-handed, which isn't 
good for you. 
Here's an extreme example: Imagine you are playing one 
on one against an opponent. If the house is taking a $3 rake 
per hand, it's very likely that neither you nor your opponent 
can possibly come out ahead. In an hour, they will be dealing 
approximately 60 hands. At $3 per rake, that would mean that 
collectively the two of you will be paying a $180 cover charge 
per hour! 
Compare that to a collection, where the house might 
charge each player $10 per hour. 
I think you can see which fee structure makes more sense. 
Understand this too: If you're playing at a table with a 
129 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
high rake, it's very important that you find a game where there 
is a lot of action with several callers before the flop. If it's a 
tight game, with mostly heads-up pots, it's probably a no-win 
proposition for all the players. 
Also, in a high rake game, remember to play both more 
conservatively and more passively to encourage your opponents 
to stay in the hand. Conversely, in a collection game, even if 
the play is very tight, you can operate super fast and loose, 
since you won't be punished for winning more pots than the 
others. 
If you have a choice, you should almost always go with 
a collection game. Sure, sometimes you'll have to pay for the 
hour—even though you didn't win a single hand—but in the 
long run, it's going to save you a ton of money. 
130 
Bankroll Management 
Making good decisions based on your current financial 
situation might just be the most important element you'll deal 
with when playing poker. You'll often be at the mercy of the 
cards, since there is undeniably an element of luck in poker. 
The deck will ultimately decide your fate. 
For that reason, you should establish strict rules for yourself 
that define how much money you're willing to risk and what 
limits to play. 
Let's say, for example, you have $ 1,000 that you've set aside 
as your poker bankroll. You'll need to know what games you 
can afford to play, budget-wise and skill-wise. 
Here are two important questions you'll need to ask 
yourself. 
1. Am I skilled enough to beat these players? 
Generally speaking, the higher the limit, the more skilled 
the player. So, if you're new to poker, it makes sense to start at 
the bottom in the lowest limit game available. 
131 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
2. How important is this $1,000 bankroll to me? 
If it's your life savings and you can't afford to lose it, well, 
frankly, you shouldn't be playing poker with it. No matter how 
big your bankroll, lady luck can take it all away from you in 
a heartbeat. However, there are some things you can do to 
protect yourself from losing it all. 
In most poker books, authors will tell you that you should 
have 300 big (blind) bets as an adequate bankroll. That's a 
pretty safe kitty. In fact, if you're a solid player who wins one 
big bet per hour, there's only a 3 percent chance of ruin if you 
stick to the appropriate limit. 
If you have a $1,000 bankroll, the correct limits for you 
to play will be between $l/$2 and $2/$4. If you want to be 
on the safe side, a $l/$2 game affords you a bankroll of 500 
big bets (1,000/2 = 500), while, if you're more of a risk taker, 
the $2/$4 game leaves you with only 250 big bets (1,000/4 = 
250). 
Now, if you feel like your skill level is good enough to win 
at the $l/$2 table, you might want to take a shot at a $2/$4 
game. When I say take a shot, it's important to understand that 
I don't mean risking the entire $1,000. 
Instead, you could invest $400 in a $2/$4 game. If you 
were to lose it, you'd still have the bankroll to go back down 
in limits with your remaining $600 and still have the required 
$300 big bets. The key to surviving is having the discipline to 
swallow your pride, take your lumps, and then move down in 
limits if things don't work out at a higher limit game. 
By the way, lack of discipline isn't solely the domain of 
amateurs. In fact, some of the most talented poker players in 
the world are currently broke, and they'll habitually go broke, 
time and time again, due to poor bankroll management. 
However, for every hard-luck story, there are the professionals 
who combine solid play and solid bankroll-management skills. 
132 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
You'll find many of them at the biggest cash game in the world, 
at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. 
And just in case you're pondering the idea of playing in that 
$4,000/$8,000 mixed game with the world's best, you'll need a 
bankroll of at least $2.4 million to give yourself a chance. You 
might be the best poker player in the world, but if you sit down 
in that game with only $500,000, you'll end up broke most of 
the time. 
If you've learned anything thus far it should be that it's 
important to take your time, play it safe for the most part, and 
don't be in a rush to play higher and higher limits. 
Living the life of a serious poker player can be stressful 
enough all by itself. The last thing you want to do is compound 
that by continually adding financial pressure to the mix. 
133 
Poker Math and Conditional Probability 
Figuring out how to do poker math doesn't require a PhD 
in mathematics. In fact, if you got past the 3rd grade, and know 
how to multiply and divide, you should be just fine. 
One important aspect of poker math entails figuring out 
the probability of a card coming to improve your hand, and 
another, assessing the likelihood of your opponent holding a 
certain hand. 
Let's say, for example, that you know for certain that 
a player will only raise with A-A, K-K, or Q,-Q, from early 
position. Now, suppose that player raises and you're looking 
down at pocket cowboys—a great K-K pair. 
You'd try to figure out whether or not you have the best 
hand, and you'd conclude that the probability is 50-50. If your 
opponent has the other K-K, that's a wash, leaving just the Qj 
Q,and A-A. The aces have you beat, you can tie the kings, and 
you can beat the queens at the moment. 
Now suppose I tell you that the player from early position 
would raise with any two cards in that position. In this situation, 
the odds of your K-K being the best hand are closer to 99 
134 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
percent. That's a simplistic view of conditional probability, of 
course, so let's look at a more complex example. 
Suppose you are at the final table of a no-limit Texas 
hold'em tournament and are dealt A-A. The player to your 
right goes all-in with a massive overbet, and you decide to just 
call, hoping that another player might enter the pot. 
Then, to your delight, the small blind, a top professional 
player, also calls. His bet tells you that he also has a strong 
starting hand. The flop comes 6-6-4. The pro player checks to 
you and you decide to get tricky by checking yourself. 
Now the turn card comes with an ace, giving you a monster 
full house. The pro bets just a little bit, and once again, you 
decide to slowplay your hand by just calling. The river brings 
another 6, for a final board of 6-6-4-A-6. 
The pro now checks to you, and it's your turn to act. The 
dilemma you face is this: You know that he won't call you 
unless he has the ace in his hand, but he will check-raise you 
all of your remaining chips if he has the last 6 for the four of 
a kind nuts. 
Since there is just one 6 and one ace remaining in the deck, 
that leaves the odds at 50-50, right? 
In a tournament setting, where survival is so important, it 
might just be wise to check this hand in case the pro was setting 
a trap for you with four of a kind. 
According to probability, it's just as likely that he has an ace 
in his hand as he does a six. Not so fast. Let's take a closer look 
at the hand and take into account the overall situation. For the 
pro player to call an all-in raise in that position, isn't it much 
more likely that he has an ace versus a 6? 
Let's take it a step further. 
If the pro player did call a raise with a 6 in his hand, what 
would be his most likely side card? Well, he couldn't have 
started with 6-6 because there are three sixes on the board, 
which leaves just A-6. Not only that, you'd then have to wonder 
135 
Cardoza Publishing * Daniel Negreanu 
whether or not he would check four of a kind on the river, 
rather than bet out himself. 
That is a stretch and a half. When you factor in conditional 
probabilities, in this particular situation, it would be extremely 
unlikely that the pro has the last 6. In fact, that 50-50 probability 
starts looking more like 99-1 in your favor. I'd even go as far 
as to say that if this was truly a pro player, the odds of him 
holding a 6 in this situation would be nil. 
One of the biggest mistakes players make when trying to 
calculate odds and figure out probability is that they neglect to 
consider conditional probability. 
The more you know about your opponent's tendencies, the 
more accurately you can calculate the probability of what he 
is holding. Always remember, it's not solely about what your 
opponent's cards are. You must consider how he plays them, 
too. 
136 
Pot Odds 
When you watch poker on TV, you hear the term pot odds 
thrown around all the time. What in the world does it really 
mean? Well, hopefully, after reading this you'll not only know 
what pot odds are, but you'll also understand how to quickly 
calculate pot odds and apply them to your game. 
A simple generic definition of the term pot odds would 
be the odds the pot is laying you in comparison to the bet you 
are facing. 
For example, if there is $500 in the pot and your opponent 
has bet $100, your pot odds would be 6 to 1. Why? Well, 
because there is already $500 in the pot and your opponent 
has bet an additional $100 for a total of $600. Since you need 
to call $100 to stay in the pot, your odds are 6 to 1. 
Simple enough, right? 
So how exacdy do you apply this basic knowledge to a 
poker hand? Here's how to figure out your pot odds, compare 
them to your actual odds, and then use this information to 
make an informed decision as to whether or not you should 
continue playing the hand.

Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
Step 1: Figuring the pot odds 
This is the easy part. You count what's already in the 
pot and add it to the amount of the bet you are facing. You 
then compare that sum to the amount your opponent has 
bet. So again, if there was, for example, $200 in the pot and 
your opponent bets $20, your pot odds would be 11 to 1 
($220/$20). 
Okay, so now that you know what your pot odds are, it's 
time to figure out if you are getting the right price to continue 
playing the hand. 
Step 2: Figuring your actual odds 
This can be a little more difficult depending on the 
situation. You can find a table of actual odds in almost any 
poker book on the market. Another option is to pick up some 
simulation software that will calculate the odds for you. But 
since you obviously won't have access to a book or software 
right there on the spot, here's how to figure out your actual 
odds while seated there at the table. 
The first thing you need to do is count your outs, meaning 
the number of remaining cards that will improve your hand. 
Then, compare that number to the total number of unseen 
cards still in the deck. Here's an example. 
Let's say the board reads K*7A6*2V, and in your hand 
you hold 8v9¥. With just one card to come on the river, you 
have eight outs: the four remaining fives and the four remaining 
tens to make your straight. 
There are 52 cards in the deck, and since you already know 
what your two cards are, as well as the four community cards 
on board, that leaves 46 unseen, unknown cards. Of those 46 
cards, eight will give you a winning straight, while 38 will miss. 
So the actual odds of making your straight then are 4.75 to 1 
(38/8= 4.75 to 1). 
Since you know the pot odds are 11 to 1 and your actual 
138 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
odds of improving your hand are 4.75 to 1, you can see that 
you're getting a great return for the investment and should call. 
If, however, there were only $20 in the pot and your opponent 
bet $20 then the pot odds would be only 2 to 1, and you 
wouldn't be making a good investment at all by calling the bet. 
In this example, even though you have eight outs, the correct 
play would be to fold the hand. 
The goal in poker is relatively straightforward and simple. 
It's not about how many pots you win. The goal is to make 
good investment decisions, as in any other business venture. 
By understanding pot odds, you can make educated decisions 
as to whether calling or folding would be good long-term 
investments. 
As is true in the stock market, if you make good decisions 
in the short-term, you'll make a decent profit in the long run. 
Soft Playing is Cheating: Play Hard or Don't Play 
What I'm about to say may surprise you. You might be a 
cheater and not even know it. 
If you are in a poker game for money and are taking it 
easy on one of your buddies, you are cheating yourself, your 
friend, and every other player in the game. I realize that's a 
bold statement, but it's absolutely true. 
In the poker world, we have a term for this type of play It's 
called soft playing. When two friends, spouses, relatives or flat-
out cheaters don't bet against each other, they're soft playing. 
Soft playing destroys the integrity of the game of poker 
and it's wrong, dead wrong. 
I realize that many players have no idea that this behavior 
is so unethical. More often than not, soft playing (not to be 
confused with slowplaying) is done innocently with no harm 
intended. Perhaps a gentleman doesn't want to take a lady's 
last $20. Or, one player doesn't want to raise his friend because 
his friend is losing too much money. 
Well, if you are so concerned with your buddy losing 
money, or if you're trying to get a date by not betting against a 
140 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
beautiful woman, try taking them both out to dinner after the 
game. The poker table is no place for compassion and kindness. 
I'm sort of kidding, but I think you get the idea. 
The unintended by-product of soft playing a friend is how 
it affects the action for the rest of the players at the table. For 
example, let's say that you and a pal both make the final table 
of a no-limit Texas hold 'em tournament that pays the top five 
finishers. There are six players remaining and you and your 
buddy are still hanging in. Remember, the next player out 
gets nothing. Everyone at the table wants to see someone get 
knocked out so that they can finish in the money. 
How do you think the other players at the table would feel 
if you are soft playing your friend? 
By not playing hard against him, you are absolutely 
cheating the other players at the table. That may not have been 
your intention, but ignorance of the rule won't get you off the 
hook when you get caught. Soft playing in a tournament can 
result in severe penalties, including disqualification to both you 
and your friend. 
Poker is not a team sport. It's every man for himself. It's 
perfectly okay to root for your buddies and hope they do well, 
but when it's time to play the game, you have to give it your all. 
All by yourself, that is. 
I've seen far too many pacts between players end up in 
shambles. I remember a husband and wife who used to play 
together. They agreed that they wouldn't bet or raise against 
each other. When the wife lost a pot to another player because 
the husband didn't raise with a hand he was supposed to, she 
chewed him out. 
"But Honey, I thought we said we wouldn't raise each 
other?" 
"Ah, forget that, you turkey, give me your best game or 
you're sleeping on the couch!" 
Arrangements like that always end up ugly. In order for 
141 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
you to do well, and for fairness to prevail, you have to play 
hard against everyone at the table. That includes Grandma, 
Grandpa, Aunt Betty, and littie Timmy. 
I mean, really, if you can't check-raise your mother, what 
kind of player are you anyway? 
Soft playing is, more often than not, totally innocent. But 
you need to be aware that there are snakes out there, and it's 
important that you spot them before they team up against 
you. 
If you're playing online and you smell something fishy, e-
mail customer support and have them investigate. At reputable 
poker sites, a representative will look into your claim by 
reviewing the hands in question, as well as the betting history 
of the suspected cheaters. If suspicious betting behavior is 
detected, the crooks will be banned from the site and you will 
likely receive a refund for the money you lost due to player 
collusion. 
If you see something strange in a live game, notify the floor 
man immediately and ask him to investigate.

Setting Up a Home Poker Tournament 
Before you decide to enter the big time arena of million-
dollar poker tournaments, you might want to practice your 
craft at home with friends first. All you really need to set up a 
tournament are some cards, poker chips, a table, and, oh yeah, 
breathing bodies. 
Of course if you want to be a good host, you might want 
to provide some munchies and beverages, too. 
Depending on what your guests are comfortable with, 
the first thing you'll have to agree on is the buy-in for the 
tournament. You can play for as little as pride or as much as 
$100 per person. Not surprisingly, when there's actual money 
being wagered the excitement level is usually higher. Playing 
socially for $20 a head should satisfy everyone's competitive 
spirit and provide a decent prize to shoot for. 
Once you've decided on the entry cost, the next step will 
be drawing for seats. If you have ten players, pull out one ace 
through ten and have each guest randomly pick a card and 
take the appropriate seat. 
Then decide on the amount of chips to start with, the blind 
143 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
structure, how long each round will last, and finally, the payout. 
For maximum fun, here's what I suggest. 
1. Starting chips. 
Start every player with $10,000 in chips, and remember, 
you don't have to actually play for $10,000 to start with that 
many chips. Give each player the following: one $5,000 
denomination value chip, three $ 1,000 chips, two $500 chips, 
and ten $100 chips. 
If you don't have enough chips to make this happen, play 
around with other chip combinations. Having four different 
chip colors will help move the game along quickly. 
2. Blind structure. 
You want to make sure that you start the blinds small 
enough so that everybody gets a chance to play for a while. On 
that note, I would suggest using the following blind structure: 
Round 1: 
Round 2: 
Round 3: 
Round 4: 
Round 5: 
Round 6: 
Round 7: 
Round 8: 
$100 small blind, $200 big blind 
$200 small blind, $400 big blind 
$400 small blind, $800 big blind 
$800 small blind, $1,600 big blind 
$1,000 small blind, $2,000 big blind 
$1,500 small blind, $3,000 big blind 
$2,000 small blind, $4,000 big blind 
$3,000 small blind, $6,000 big blind 
Depending on how much time you have and how skillful 
you want the tournament to be, you can add or take away 
rounds accordingly. The more rounds there are, the more 
expertise is needed to win. 
144 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
3. Length of rounds. 
One method is to choose a time limit—ten or fifteen minute 
rounds should do the trick. Another option is to have the blinds 
escalate after every lap around the table. For example, if you 
start the dealer button in Seat One, every time the button returns 
to that seat, increase the blinds. If Seat One is eliminated, then 
raise blinds when the button returns to Seat Two. 
I like this method best because it speeds things up later in 
the tournament so that eliminated players won't have to wait 
around too long without playing. 
I've played in many house games before, and we never have 
just one tournament. Everyone will be anxious to get back in 
the action, so the faster you raise the blinds, the less time your 
guests will have to wait around and raid your fridge! 
4. Spoils to the winners. 
You'll need to consider how to divide up the money, if 
you play for money at all. Typically, you'll have three options: 
winner takes all, pay 1st and 2nd place, or pay the top three 
finishers. 
If you have ten players putting up $20 each, you'll have a 
$200 prize pool. The best payout structure to ensure that your 
guests don't get hurt too bad financially is to pay the top three 
places. The 1st place finisher gets 50 percent of the prize pool 
or $100. The 2nd place winner earns 30 percent or $60. The 
3rd place player takes home 20 percent or $40. 
The best way to decide on the payout structure is to provide 
three options and have the players vote on which one they like 
best. 
Remember, when hosting a tournament poker party, your 
main concern should be in making sure that everyone is happy 
and having a great time. 
Well, that and trying to win all the money.

Heads-Up Poker 
The National Heads-Up Poker Championship pits 64 of 
the best players in the world against each other, head to head, 
in a bracket format. I absolutely love this tournament because 
I believe that heads-up poker is the most skill-oriented form of 
the game. 
In some ways, heads-up poker is less about playing 
the actual cards you are dealt and more about playing your 
opponent. The goal is to find your challenger's weaknesses and 
then exploit them. All the while, you're trying to mask your 
own strategy so that he doesn't figure you out. 
When it comes to heads-up play, there is one absolute: You 
really need to get in there and fight. Conservative play isn't 
effective at all in a heads-up match. In a full ring game, with 
9 or 10 players, sure, you can sit back and wait for premium 
cards if you like. If you are playing heads-up, however, your 
starting hand requirements must be lowered considerably. 
In fact, most limit hold'em experts agree that when battling 
heads-up you should play well over 80 percent of the hands 
dealt to you. Contrast that to playing approximately 20 percent 
146 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
of the hands dealt to you in a full ring game. Nearly the same 
holds true in no-limit hold'em, but the percentage may not be 
quite as high. 
The key reason that you need to get more involved when 
playing heads-up is that you're forced to ante up every single 
hand. The player with the dealer button must post the small 
blind while the other player puts up the big blind. 
By the way, this is the only situation in hold'em where the 
button is ever forced to act first. After the flop, play resumes as 
normal with the button acting last on every subsequent street. 
The best way to improve your heads-up game is to actually 
get your feet wet and play. You can do that on the Internet at 
numerous free sites, or if you're feeling adventurous you can 
play for real money. Of course, you can also just practice with 
friends. 
Improving your heads-up play will have a positive effect on 
your overall skill level, even at a full table. The decisions you are 
forced to make in heads-up are often so much more complex 
than those you would ponder at a full table. Practicing these 
tough decisions makes the routine decisions just that—routine. 
Imagine shooting hoops on a very small and tight rim. If you 
got adept doing that, then making baskets on a regular-sized 
rim would seem very easy to you. 
When playing heads-up, your main focus must be on what 
your opponent is doing. Is she playing weak or strong? Does 
she bluff too much or is she always betting only the strongest 
hands? The more questions you can successfully answer, the 
better profile you'll have on your opponent. 
Once a profile is established, it's then your job to devise a 
strategy that will best exploit your opponent's weakness. For 
example, if she folds too often on the flop, then you should 
bluff more on the flop. Or, if she folds too much before the 
flop, you should raise more often prior to the flop. Conversely, 
147 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
if your opponent calls too often, you should bluff her less and 
bet your mediocre hands for more value. 
There is one other key thing you need to focus on— 
yourself. 
Do not allow yourself to fall into predictable patterns that 
your opponent will be able to exploit. You don't want to play 
every hand the same way. Use all of the tools in your arsenal: 
the check-raise, the slowplay, coming over the top, the bluff 
raise on the turn, and even the smooth call on the flop. This is 
commonly known as mixing it up. Mixing it up keeps your 
opponent guessing, and that's exactly where you want him to be. 
Here's one final thought on the game. You must avoid 
coming into a heads-up match with a predetermined strategy. 
Until you have an idea as to how your opponent might play, 
that strategy of yours may be the wrong one. It's important to 
be able to adapt quickly to what the other player is throwing 
at you. 
148 
What to Look for in Heads-Up Poker 
There are some significant differences between playing 
heads-up poker and more common poker games where six to 
nine players compete at a table. The type of hands you should 
play, and the way you should play them, are very different from 
a standard game. 
Here are a few things to look for whenever you watch 
heads-up play. 
Who is the aggressor? 
In heads-up play, the player who employs a more aggressive 
style will generally come out on top. The reason is rather 
simple. Because it's so difficult to hit a flop, true heads-up poker 
skills are shown when both players have absolutely nothing 
after the first three community cards are dealt. The player who 
consistendy wins this trench warfare is the one who will usually 
win the overall battle. 
Who is the caller? 
When you continue to put yourself in situations where 
149 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
you're facing an opponent's bet, it becomes increasingly more 
difficult to make correct decisions. For that reason, you want to 
be the bettor, not the caller. 
Checking and calling can be a viable strategy to trap a 
player. However, if you're always in a situation where you're 
guessing the power of an opponent's hand, guess what, you'll 
end up guessing wrong too often. 
Trapping an opponent is an art form. It can be done many 
different ways using a myriad of poker tools. One notable 
method is to slowplay a hand. Slowplaying can be dangerous, 
though, because you might give your opponent a chance to 
catch a lucky card on the river to beat you. 
The key to being a successful trapper is to not get caught 
in the trap yourself! If your trap fails, you have to be willing to 
abort the mission and change strategies quickly. 
Let's say, for example, in a heads-up match, you just call 
before the flop holding a pair of kings. Now the flop comes 
A<fc7v4*. Sure, you started with a very powerful hand, but 
this flop is dangerous and puts your cowboys in peril. If your 
opponent holds an ace, only two cards left in the deck can save 
you. 
While you tried to set a trap, it didn't spring as you hoped. 
Proceed with caution. Don't let yourself lose a big pot after 
that flop. 
Another important element you should look for during 
heads-up play are the escalating blinds. As the blinds continue 
to increase, the quality of hands that players go all-in with will 
diminish. 
In the first round of play, for example, if two players go 
all-in before the flop, you'll likely see a confrontation like K-K 
versus Q-0_, or even A-A facing K-K. However, after about 
the fifth level, the blinds become so large that both players will 
gamble more loosely in defense of their blinds. By that point, 
150 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
it's common to see all-in pots where one player may hold a 
hand as weak as A-3 and the opponent calls all-in with K-10. 
In my opinion, heads-up poker is the wave of the future. 
More and more people are playing it today than ever before. 
You can even qualify for the National Heads-Up Poker 
Championship by playing online. That's exacdy what Josh 
Lochner did. He beat out 30,000 other hopefuls to win his spot 
in the 2006 Championship's exclusive 64-player field.

Playing Short-Handed 
There hasn't been much discussion in poker books dealing 
with the topic of playing in a short-handed game, that is, playing 
against a small number of opponents. 
Most Texas hold'em games are played with nine, ten, or 
even eleven players seated at the table. In a game like this, 
you can afford to sit tight, and wait for premium hands before 
entering a pot. Since you only have to pay a blind twice per 
round, the pressure to play lots of hands just isn't there. 
When you're playing short-handed, however, you are 
forced to play more hands since each one you throw away will 
actually cost you more money. Let me explain. 
Let's say you're sitting in a ten-handed hold'em game with 
$5/$ 10 blinds. One round circling the table would cost you 
$15 total if you didn't play a hand. That's an average of $1.50 
per hand ($15/10 hands), which doesn't seem too bad, but look 
what happens when you cut the number of players from ten to 
five. 
Now, a lap around the table costs the same $15, but you'd 
only get to see five hands. That means, on average, it will cost 
152 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
you $3 for every hand you fold. If you take that a step further, 
in a three-handed game, you'd be paying $ 15 to see just three 
hands. That's $5 per hand! 
The ante and blind structure dictates how loosely you 
should be playing. If, for example, there were no blinds or antes 
at all, it would be silly to play any hand in hold'em other than 
pocket aces. However, since you do have to pay a penalty for 
waiting for the best cards, playing only A~A would cause your 
chip stack to get anted off, round by round. 
Okay, that should help explain why it's important to play 
more hands in a short-handed game. It's also important to 
understand what hands you should add to your repertoire, and 
how you should play them. 
In short-handed games, hands that do well hot and cold, 
meaning that they could win without improvement, go up 
in value, while speculative hands, like 7-6 suited, go down in 
value. 
It's very different at a ten-handed table. 
A hand like 7-6 suited does very well when there are five or 
six players seeing the flop. Something like K-7 offsuit doesn't 
fare as well. Conversely, the K-7 does much better in short-
handed situations than does the 7-6 suited. 
In short-handed play, it's also more important to maintain 
an aggressive style than it would be in a full ring game. 
In a full game, if a player raises from early position and 
you, in middle position, hold a pair of fours, there is no need to 
even get involved with the hand. You can safely fold since you 
have nothing invested. 
In a five-handed game, however, this would be an 
opportunity to get aggressive and reraise before the flop. Yes, I 
understand that it's a small pair, but a 4-4 is still the favorite to 
win, even against the Big Slick, A-K, heads-up. 
As a rule, short-handed play is more of a battle for the 
antes, while full ring game play is more about waiting on 
153 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
premium cards in good situations. There isn't as much pressure 
to play, because the blinds don't come around as fast. 
That's why so many players seem afraid of playing a short-
handed game. It's high-stress, high-energy poker that forces 
you to make complex decisions with much weaker hands. 
Frankly, short-handed games are where stronger players 
thrive while weaker opponents simply get pushed around. 
154 
World Series of Poker 
Without a doubt, the World Series of Poker (WSOP) is the 
richest event in sports, and it grows by leaps and bounds each 
year. Since 1970, when there were just a handful of players 
starting this great tradition, the number of entrants slowly 
increased—until recently. 
Today, we're seeing an explosion that's changing the event 
forever and has caused poker to reach heights no one could 
have ever imagined. When Chris Moneymaker, a complete 
unknown, won it all in 2003, there were an astounding 839 
players, up over 300 players from 2002. 
ESPN's coverage of the Moneymaker phenomena opened 
the floodgates, and in 2004 we saw 2,576 players pony up 
$ 10,000 each trying to be the next Moneymaker—literally and 
figuratively. That year, Greg "Fossilman" Raymer became the 
third straight nonprofessional player to win the most coveted 
title in poker. 
It was virtually a given that the 2005 no-limit Main Event 
would once again break the record for number of entrants. 
Online poker sites held small satellite tournaments where 
155 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
wannabes could qualify for the most prestigious event in poker 
for as litde as $9. 
The final count in 2005 was 5,619 players for a whopping 
$56.6 million prize pool, with the winner earning $7.5 million. 
Only about 300 of those players were pros. So, once again, an 
amateur was expected to win it all. Why? It's a simple numbers 
game. 
In years past, when the tournament attracted 200 to 300 
players, well over half of the entrants were professional poker 
players. While the number of pros hasn't risen dramatically, 
the number of amateurs willing to put up ten grand of their 
own money has skyrocketed. 
Which begs the question: Will a top professional ever 
win the WSOP main event again? I think so, but because of 
the sheer number of entrants, it's certainly not going to be a 
favorite to happen. 
Don't get me wrong, the pros are still the favorites. If you 
could bet on the 300 pros versus 300 amateurs, you'd be a large 
favorite. That's not how it works, of course, but I think you see 
my point. 
In 2005, you would have been hard-pressed to call anyone 
at the final table a loser. When Mike "The Mouth" Matusow 
was eliminated in ninth place he represented the last remaining 
professional. Luckily, for Mike, that ninth place finish netted a 
cool one million bucks. Not bad for a week's work! 
Of the eight remaining players, not one had ever won 
a world championship bracelet at the WSOP. All eight were 
relative unknowns. Joseph Hachem of Melbourne, Australia 
ultimately beat out Steven Dannenmann of Severn, Maryland, 
and instandy became a poker celebrity. 
A week prior, no one in the poker world had ever heard of 
these two men. Now they sure have. They're known to millions 
around the world thanks to ESPN. 
156 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
There's one colossal thing that separates poker from other 
sports you'll watch on TV You'll never bask in the glory of 
Wimbledon. You'll never experience the thrill of hitting a 
three-pointer at the buzzer to win Game 7 of the NBA Finals. 
You'll never have the chance to chip in for birdie on 18 to steal 
the Masters crown from Tiger Woods. 
But you might be able to bust Phil Hellmuth, or bluff out 
Phil Ivey, or even take down a huge pot from that blonde-
haired, earring-wearing guy with the goatee, and actually win 
the Holy Grail of poker. 
For poker purists, however, the World Series of Poker will 
never be the same. 
Look at the WSOP Wall of Champions—Johnny Chan, 
Doyle Brunson, Johnny Moss, Stu Ungar, all legends in the 
poker community. It gives you goose bumps. Many wonder if 
those days are gone forever. The nostalgic club of gamblers is 
making way for a more corporate-run lottery: poker for the 
masses. 
The pros shouldn't be complaining too much, though, as 
they're getting a hefty pay raise. Some use their sudden fame to 
sell products, while others are just cashing in on tournaments 
with much,larger prize pools. 
As recent as 2001, 9th place in the main event paid 
$91,910. In 2006, Jamie Gold earned $12,500,000 for his first 
place finish. 
Complaining? Who's complaining!

Exploiting Your Table Image 
Understanding how people perceive you at the poker table 
is often as important as knowing which cards to play. In fact, 
the most important adjustment I was forced to make, in order 
to beat the world's best players, was to become aware of how 
my play was affecting my table image. 
Here's an extremely simple example to illustrate my point. 
Let's say that in a fifteen-minute span you've been caught 
bluffing four times. Well, if your opponents are even slightly 
perceptive, they'll notice that tendency. Further bluffing is 
going to be much less effective. That fact will either help you or 
hurt you depending on how well you adjust to your perceived 
table image. 
In one sense, your bluffing spree will likely cause your 
opponents to call you with much weaker hands. They're hoping 
that you're still bluffing. When you do catch a very strong hand, 
you won't have to do anything tricky to ensure getting full value 
for the hand. 
On the other side of the coin, you have to be aware that 
158 
Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
your bluffs will be called more often, so you'd be wise to tighten 
up your play and wait for better starting cards. 
There are pros and cons to being pegged as a mad bluffer. 
You'll no longer be able to steal pots that you might otherwise 
have been able to take down with a timely bet. But at the same 
time, you'll get full value for your strong nonbluffing hands. 
As you can see, although your table image is established, you 
can make adjustments to exploit that image and use it to your 
advantage. 
Here's another example: You've been playing for five hours 
and haven't been dealt many good cards. It's been one fold after 
another, making it look like you're playing very conservatively. 
The few hands you've played were very powerful ones. 
Well, this tight, conservative table image also has its pros 
and cons. Your opponents notice that you play like the Rock of 
Gibraltar, and that when you bet, you always have a monster 
hand. Use that table image to your advantage and steal some 
huge pots! Since everyone has you pegged as Mr. Tight Guy 
who only plays the nuts, your bets will get significant respect. 
You can profit from this conservative table image as well. 
Yes, you'll lose a little value when you have a strong hand, but 
you'll more than make up for it when you have a weak hand 
and bluff at a huge pot. 
Other behaviors will also have an impact on your table 
image. 
Let's say that you've been on a killer rush and are winning 
every pot in sight. Your opponents may begin to fear you, 
thinking, "Man, this guy is just too lucky." On top of that, your 
positive frame of mind will disturb players who are losing so 
many pots to you. This is an excellent table image to cultivate 
and will cause your frustrated opponents to make more errors. 
Conversely, if you're running very unlucky—losing every 
pot on the river—your opponents will likely attempt to take 
advantage of you. They'll presume that you're on tilt since

you've been losing so much. This gives them even more 
confidence. 
In this situation, don't let them see you sweat, and don't 
complain or cry. Your opponents should never know that your 
cold streak is affecting you. When you're getting beat up at the 
tables, you simply need to take your lumps and walk away. 
Of course, when the cards are coming and your table 
image is working, that's the time to exploit it. That's when you 
want everyone to know how you're feeling. Say something like, 
"Man, I'm just hitting every hand. The cards keep coming and 
coming!" 
Reinforce your image of being "too lucky" and you'll 
maintain a psychological edge over your opponents.

Dealing with Bad Beats 
I'm probably asked this poker question more than any 
other. How do you deal with bad beats? 
It's a relevant question, especially considering how 
important it is to be able to handle those painful stings of bad 
luck that you'll inevitably encounter. 
There are definitely some do's and don'ts when it comes to 
dealing with bad beats. Let's first look at a few of the don'ts. 
1. Don't tell bad beat stories. 
Do you want a sure-fire way of guaranteeing that nobody 
will talk to you? Just tell them how unlucky you've been and 
how they wouldn't believe the hand you just lost with. 
Look, they really don't care. Bad beats happen to 
everyone. 
I mean, seriously, have you ever looked forward to someone 
telling you a hard-luck story? Keep your bad beats to yourself. 
2. Don't go on tilt. 
What often happens to players when their luck runs bad 
161 
Cardoza Publishing • Daniel Negreanu 
is that they start playing poorly. They go on tilt. They chase 
hands they normally wouldn't or try something new because, 
hey, playing good cards just isn't working. 
Reacting in this manner will wreck your game. You don't 
have to try something new. You need to focus more keenly on 
playing well and sticking to your game plan despite the bad run 
of cards. 
3. Don't let your opponents see you sweat. 
If they know you've been running bad, their confidence 
against you will soar. They will surely look for the opportunity 
to attack. Like sharks circling their prey, once they see you're 
wounded, they'll move in for the kill. 
You must keep your composure at the poker table and not 
let bad beats affect your play. Staying calm and focused will go 
a long way towards making a quick recovery. 
Keep this in mind, too: When players ask how your cards 
have been running, it's a trick. Answer shrewdly by saying, 
"Pretty good, actually. I've been on a nice streak lately." 
You might know that the cards have turned to ice, but your 
opponents don't need to know it. Remember, deception is 
fundamental to the game of poker. 
And now for some of the do's to help you get out of the 
bad beat blues. 
1. Take some time off. 
This is the absolute best way to reenergize your batteries 
when the cards start spitting in your face. You need a clear 
head so that you can focus on making good decisions. 
When you start wondering how your pocket pair of aces is 
going to lose the next hand, you are in desperate need for some 
downtime!

Hold'em Wisdom for All Players 
2. Play smaller limit games. 
It's often difficult for players to move from their regular 
limit games to a smaller limit game, but that's exactly what I 
recommend that you do. 
Swallow your pride and regain your confidence by playing 
against (and beating) weaker players in smaller limit games. 
3. Stay positive. 
If you believe you're an unlucky player, you'll become one. 
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, and it's true in any facet of your 
life. 
Focus on making correct decisions at the poker table and 
not on the outcome. That's how the best players approach the 
game of poker. 
Yes, I realize that maintaining composure and staying 
positive is easier said than done. I've been there before, too. All 
poker players have been there before. When you start thinking 
you are the unluckiest player in the world, I can assure you that 
it's a tie. You and about a million other players can make that 
claim. 
For some poker players, it's often "If only I were as lucky as 
that scrawny litde goateed guy with two earrings. I could beat 
him, but he's too lucky." 
You'd better believe that I'm lucky, and not just in poker. 
I'm lucky in life because I was raised by two wonderful parents, 
I have my health, and I live in a free country. 
If you focus on all of the good things you have going on in 
your life, all of a sudden, a bad run of cards just doesn't seem 
so important now, does it?

Final Thoughts 
I hope you enjoyed reading this book as much as I enjoying 
writing it. You probably noticed a couple of recurring themes 
throughout each of these short chapters. Each defines my 
approach to winning, and hopefully, will add to your enjoyment 
and success in the game. 
If you want to become a better player, a winning player, 
first and foremost, you'll need to learn the fundamentals of 
the game. Read a variety of poker books, watch poker on 
television, and of course, gather as much playing experience as 
you can—in cardrooms and home games, on the Internet, and 
in tournament play. 
Also, make sure to think outside the box. It's not enough to 
simply memorize how to play certain hands, it's important to 
understand why the hand should be played that way. Poker is a 
beautiful game with so many variables, you can't play it with a 
defined set of rules as you would in blackjack. Don't be afraid 
to experiment with different strategies. Even if they fail, you 
will have learned something. 
One final thing: Play the game with style and grace. There 
165

is just no good reason to be a jerk at the poker table. By being 
a nice guy, I think you'll find that you'll do better in both poker 
and life. And, always be respectful of your competition—while 
you try to take all their money!
