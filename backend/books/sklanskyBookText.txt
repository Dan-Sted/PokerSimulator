and tournament hold 'em, it teaches all the fundamental concepts necessary to start winning right 
away.

and Mason Malmuth teaches you to win the maximum in today's small stakes games. It covers

protecting your hand, waiting for the turn, going for overcalls, and betting marginal hands for 
value. If your opponents play too many hands and go too far with them, this book is for you.
Hold 'em Poker by David Sklansky is must reading for anyone planning to play anyplace 
that hold 'em is offered. Covers the importance of position, the first two cards, the key "flops," 
how to read hands, and general strategy. This was the first accurate book on hold 'em and has now 
been updated for today's double blind structure.

poker, blackjack, other casino games, sports betting, and general gambling concepts. This book 
contains some of the most sophisticated gambling ideas that have ever been put into print.

About David Sklansky
David Sklansky is generally considered the number one 
authority on gambling in the world today. Besides his ten books 
on the subject, David also has produced two videos and numerous 
writings for various gaming publications. His occasional poker 
seminars always receive an enthusiastic reception including those 
given at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and the World Series of 
Poker in Las Vegas.
More recently David has been doing consulting work for 
casinos, Internet gaming sites, and gaming device companies. He 
has recently invented a new game called Poker Challenge, soon 
to appear in casinos.
David attributes his standing in the gambling community 
to three things:
1.The fact that he presents his ideas as simply as possible
(sometimes with Mason Malmuth and/or Ed Miller) even
though these ideas frequently involve concepts that are
deep, subtle, and not to be found elsewhere.
2.The fact that the things he says and writes can be counted
on to be accurate.
3.The fact that to this day a large portion of his income is
still    derived   from   gambling   (usually   poker   but
occasionally blackjack,  sports  betting,  horses,  video
games, casino promotions, or casino tournaments).
Thus, those who depend on David's advice know that he 
still depends on it himself.

Preface
This book is about the general theories and concepts of poker 
play, which are operative in nearly every variation of poker from 
five-card draw to Texas hold 'em. It is not a how-to book in the 
sense of providing the basic rules and a step-by-step procedure for 
playing the various games. Beginning poker players sometimes 
ask, "What do you do in this particular situation?" There is really 
no correct answer to that question because it's the wrong question. 
Rules of thumb that say to fold one hand, call with another, and 
raise with yet another simply won't get a poker player beyond the 
beginning stages.
The  right question  is:  "What do  you  consider  in  this 
particular situation before determining what to do?" The Theory 
of Poker addresses itself to such considerations. It analyzes every 
aspect of a poker hand from the ante structure to play after the last 
card has been dealt. By explaining the logic of poker, the book 
will, I hope, show the reader what kinds of things to think about 
in order to become a better player.
To illustrate the concepts presented, I use primarily five 
games  —  five-card  draw, seven-card  stud, hold  'em,  draw 
lowball, and razz or seven-card lowball. For readers who may not 
be familiar with one or another of these games, I give brief 
summaries of their rules in the Appendix. I also use standard 
poker terms like flop, on board, sixth street, back-door flush, and 
the like. As much as possible, I explain these terms in the text, but 
readers can avail themselves of the Glossary of Poker Terms at 
the back of the book to check the definitions of any terms about 
which they are uncertain.
The Theory of Poker is an expansion and total revision of the 
book Sklansky on Poker Theory, written by David Sklansky and 
originally published by Gambler's Book Club of Las Vegas in 
1978. That book was directed primarily to professional poker

players. This book is directed to poker players in general, who 
know the basics, who may even be good players, but who want to 
delve deeper into the inner workings of the game. It is not an easy 
book, but a careful reading of it should reap rich rewards. Note: 
This book was formerly titled Winning Poker.
_______________Chapter One
Beyond Beginning Poker
The beauty of poker is that on the surface it is a game of utter 
simplicity, yet beneath the surface it is profound, rich, and full of 
subtlety. Because its basic rules are so simple, anyone can learn 
poker in a few minutes, and novice players may even think they're 
pretty good after a few hours. From the expert's point of view, the 
veneer of simplicity that deludes so many players into thinking 
they're good is the profitable side of the game's beauty. It doesn't 
take long for pool players or golfers to realize they're outclassed 
and to demand that a match be handicapped, but losers in poker 
return to the table over and over again, donating their money and 
blaming their losses on bad luck, not bad play.
It's true that in any given session the best of players can get 
unlucky. Going into the final day of the 1981 world championship 
of poker, Bobby Baldwin of Tulsa, Oklahoma, had a substantial 
lead over the eight other surviving players. Within a couple of 
hours he had two hands beat when his opponents outdrew him on 
the final card on 21-to-l shots. Suddenly he was out of the 
tournament. Coincidentally, in both hands Baldwin's opponent 
needed one of the two remaining queens among the 44 unseen 
cards, and he got it.
However, it is more likely for a good player like Baldwin to 
suffer these bad beats, as they are called, than for an average 
player or a weak player to suffer them. "I've heard good players 
complain to me about how they get drawn out on all the time," 
Baldwin said after the 1981 tournament. "But if they want to 
better their game and better their emotional state while playing, 
they should realize it's a mirage. If you are an excellent player, 
People are going to draw out on you a lot more than you're going 
to draw out on them because they're simply going to have the 
worst hand against you a lot more times than you have the worst
2 Chapter One
hand against them. There's no way you're going to draw out on 
anybody if you don't get all your money in there on the worst 
hand."
As Baldwin implies, expert players do not rely on luck. They 
are at war with luck. They use their skills to minimize luck as 
much as possible. They figure they're getting the best of it, and 
they leave lucky draws to their weaker opponents. To the extent 
that they are getting the best of it, they will win more often than 
they lose. Over the long run everybody gets the same proportion 
of good and bad cards, of winning and losing hands. Beginning 
poker players rely on big hands and lucky draws. Expert poker 
players use their skills to minimize their losses on their bad hands 
and maximize their profits on their big hands. They also are able 
to judge better than others when a big hand is not the best hand 
and when a small hand is the best hand.
Whatever your level of play, the succeeding chapters will 
introduce you to theories and concepts of poker that will eliminate 
your reliance on luck and lead you to become an expert who relies 
on his skills. For above all, you must remember that poker is not 
primarily a game of luck. It is a game of skill.
The Forms of Poker
Poker is a generic name for literally hundreds of games, but 
they all fall within a few interrelated types. There are high games 
like seven-card stud and Texas hold 'em, in which the highest 
hand in the showdown wins, and low games like draw lowball and 
razz, in which the lowest hand wins. There are also high-low split 
games, in which the best high hand and the best low hand split the 
pot. Among high, low, and high-low split games there are those 
like five-card draw, in which the hands are closed, and those like 
seven-card stud, in which some of the players' cards are exposed 
for all to see.
Jokers, wild cards, and special rules may be introduced into 
any of these games to create such aberrations as Baseball, Follow 
the Queen, Anaconda, and scores of other variations that have
Beyond Beginning Poker 3
spiced up home poker for decades. Paradoxically, the two types 
of players who favor these exotic poker variations are generally 
amateurs who want a lot of action and hustlers who prey on these 
amateurs because their long experience allows them to adjust 
more easily to unusual games than their amateur opponents can. 
However, before a player can become an expert at exotic games, 
he must understand the basic concepts of standard games.
Another significant distinction among poker games is their 
betting structure. Most home games and most games in Las 
Vegas, Gardena, California, and elsewhere are limit games—that 
is, games in which limits are set on the minimum and maximum 
bets. Normally, in the smaller-limit games of Las Vegas, such as 
$l-$3 seven-card stud, there is no ante, and the low card starts the 
action for 50 cents. In subsequent rounds, the high hand on board 
may check or bet $1, $2, or $3. In the higher-limit Las Vegas 
games and in the limit draw games of the card rooms of Gardena, 
the betting is rigidly structured. In Gardena the bets double after 
the draw. In Las Vegas they double in the later rounds of betting. 
In $5-$ 10 seven-card stud, for example, there is a 50-cent ante, 
low card starts the action, or brings it in, for $ 1, and on the next 
round the bets and raises must be $5, no more and no less. With 
an open pair after four cards, a player generally has the option of 
betting $5 or $ 10, but anyone who raises must raise $10. After the 
fifth, sixth, and seventh cards, the bets and raises must be $10 
whether or not anyone has a pair showing.
In other poker games the betting structure might be pot-limit 
or no-limit. In a pot-limit game, bets and raises may be for any 
amount up to the size of the pot. Thus, with a $10 pot, someone 
might bet $10 and be called by three players. The last player to 
call can raise $50, the current size of the pot. If one player calls 
the raise, the size of the pot would then be $ 150 so that in the next 
round the first bet could be anything up to that amount.
In no-limit poker, a player may bet or raise any amount up to 
what he has in front of him/her at any time. If he has $500 in front 
of him, he can bet that. If he has $50,000 in front of him, he can 
bet that. He cannot, however, raise a player with less money out
4 Chapter One
of a pot. That player may simply call with the money in front of 
him and a side pot is created for any remaining players. If his 
hand prevails, the player who is "all-in" can win only the money 
he called in the main pot, and the best hand among those 
remaining wins the side pot. (The same mechanics apply to limit 
games when a player is all-in.)
Notwithstanding the great variety of poker games — high 
games and low games, stud games and draw games, limit games 
and no-limit games — there is an inner logic that runs through all 
of them, and there are general precepts, concepts, and theories that 
apply to all of them. However experienced a player may be with 
the rules and methods of a specific game, like, say, five-card 
draw, only by understanding and applying the underlying concepts 
of poker can he move confidently to the expert level. The 
principles of such stratagems as the semi-bluff (Chapter Eleven) 
and slowplaying (Chapter Fifteen) are essentially the same in limit 
five-card draw poker as in no-limit hold 'em poker, and they are 
equally important.
Poker Logic
Poker logic is not tricks and ploys. In weaker games tricks 
and ploys may sometimes work — for example, gesturing as 
though to fold your hand and then raising after the third man in 
the pot has called. However, a super hustler with an arsenal of 
tricks and ploys who is not also a good player will not get the 
money against tough competition. Some poker writers make tricks 
and ploys the essence of poker; the best that can be said of them 
is they are misguided. Some players substitute tricks and ploys for 
sound precepts and sound play. They act surly, try to anger other 
players in the game — in a word, use almost any gimmick other 
than good play to win the money on the table. In the world of 
professional Las Vegas poker, such players never rise to the 
bigger games, and eventually, their tricks and ploys played out, 
they fade into the Las Vegas night like so many failed gamblers, 
earning a living driving a cab.
Beyond Beginning Poker 5
Nor  is  poker  logic purely  mathematical.  Knowing the 
mathematics of poker can certainly help you play a better game. 
However, mathematics is only a small part of poker logic, and 
while it is important, it is far less important than understanding 
and using the underlying concepts of poker.
It is important to understand that poker is a much more 
difficult game than most people realize, that it can be more 
complex than bridge or backgammon. The concepts in this book 
are intended to make you understand the depth of the game and to 
make you a good player against tough competition. (Obviously if 
you can beat tough games, you will have little trouble destroying 
easier games.) While the concepts discussed often apply to all 
poker games, they relate particularly to limit games. Properly 
adjusted, they also relate to pot-limit and no-limit games. 
However, they do not always relate to games like high-low split, 
in which there are two winners in a pot.
The Object of Poker
Whether you are playing $1-limit poker at the kitchen table 
or pot-limit poker at the Stardust in Las Vegas, whether you are 
playing poker for fun or for a living, once a week or every day, 
you have to understand that the object of the game is to make 
money. That's where the profits are. That's where the fun is. 
That's the way the game is scored. Jack Straus, 1982 poker 
champion, has said he'd bust his own grandmother if she was in 
a pot with him, which is pretty much the only attitude a serious 
poker player can have when he or she sits down behind a stack of 
chips. Whatever the environment and whoever your opponents 
happen to be, you must play the game tough; you must play the 
game to win money. That does not mean you cannot joke or 
socialize, whether at the kitchen table or in a Las Vegas card 
room. Quite to the contrary. In a public card room people seem to 
mind losing their money to a sociable person less than losing it to 
a mole. However, when the cards are dealt, you are no longer a 
grandson, a friend, or a nice guy; you are a player.
6 Chapter One
To say a poker player is out to make money does not 
necessarily mean he is out to win pots. Of course, you can't win 
money without winning pots, but attempting to win every pot or 
too many pots is a losing proposition. If you win $100 in one pot 
but lose $ 120 trying to win four others, you have a net loss of $20. 
You may occasionally be in a game where the best strategy is to 
win as many pots as possible, but such games are exceptions. In 
most games the bets you save are as important as the bets you 
win, because your real goal is to maximize your wins and 
minimize your losses. Ideally you want the pots you win to be as 
big as possible and the pots you lose to contain nothing more than 
your ante. You must remember that reducing losses — by not 
making the calls, for example, that a weaker player would make
— adds that much more to your win when the game is over.
Many players don't follow this precept, however obvious it 
may seem. They play as though they want to win the pot, an 
individual pot, at all costs. The worst of them, to put it bluntly, are 
the suckers in the game. On the other hand, a good player 
develops the patience to wait for the right situations to play a pot 
and develops the discipline to release a hand he judges to be
second-best.
Just as it is important not to think in terms of individual pots
— not to chase money you have contributed to an individual pot
— so it is important to realize you are not playing in individual
games. Each individual game is part of one big poker game. You
cannot win every game or session you play, anymore than a golfer
or bowler can win every match he or she plays. If you are a
serious poker player, you must think in terms of your win at the
end of the year or the end of the month — or, as sometimes
happens, of your loss at the end of the year or the end of the
month, which, of course, you want to keep as small as possible.
Thus, whether you are winning or losing on a given night is 
not in itself important, and above all it must not affect your play. 
It's easy to get steamed, or disgruntled or discouraged, when 
you're losing. However, you must be disciplined enough to play 
every hand correctly, regardless of how you are doing.
Beyond Beginning Poker 7
Similarly, you should not allow the fact that you are winning 
or losing to affect your decision to stay in or quit a game. From a 
money making point of view the only criterion for playing is 
whether you're a favorite in the game or an underdog. If you're a 
significant favorite, then it's a good game, and you should stay in 
it; if you're an underdog, then it's a bad game which you should 
quit. Never quit a good game as a small winner just to ensure a 
winning session. By the same token, don't continue playing in a 
bad game just to get even.
Even for tough professionals, quitting a game, particularly 
when they're stuck — that is, when they've lost money — is 
sometimes a hard thing to do. So long as you remain a big 
favorite, you should stay, even if it means using toothpicks to prop 
up your eyelids. But if the game has changed so that you're an 
underdog, you should quit whether you're a winner or loser. When 
you're stuck, you should examine the reasons why you're stuck. 
It may be just bad luck, but it may not. Are there too many players 
better than you? Is there cheating going on? Perhaps you yourself 
are playing worse than you normally do. Are you tired or 
distracted? Are you thinking about the football game you bet or 
the woman who's been "busy" the last four times you asked her 
out? Are you shaken up over a bad beat earlier in the session when 
someone drew a fourth deuce to beat your aces full? Making 
money is the object of poker, and making money involves saving 
it on bad nights as well as winning it on good nights. So don't 
worry about quitting a loser. If you have the best of it, you will 
win in the long run just as surely as a roulette wheel will win for 
the casino in the long run.

Expectation and Hourly Rate
Mathematical Expectation
Mathematical expectation is the amount a bet will average 
winning or losing. It is an extremely important concept for the 
gambler because it shows him how to evaluate most gambling 
problems. Using mathematical expectation is also the best way to 
analyze most poker plays.
Let's say you are betting a friend $ 1, even money, on the flip 
of a coin. Each time it comes up heads, you win; each time it 
comes up tails, you lose. The odds of its coming up heads are 1-
to-1, and you're betting $l-to-$l. Therefore, your mathematical 
expectation  is  precisely  zero  since  you  cannot  expect, 
mathematically, to be either ahead or behind after two flips or 
after 200 flips.
Your hourly rate is also zero. Hourly rate is the amount of 
money you expect to win per hour. You might be able to flip a 
coin 500 times an hour, but since you are getting neither good nor 
bad odds, you will neither earn nor lose money. From a serious 
gambler's point of view, this betting proposition is not a bad one. 
It's just a waste of time.
But let's say some imbecile is willing to bet $2 to your $1 on 
the flip of the coin. Suddenly you have a positive expectation of 
50 cents per bet. Why 50 cents? On the average you will win one 
bet for every bet you lose. You wager your first dollar and lose 
$1; you wager your second and win $2. You have wagered $1 
twice, and you are $1 ahead. Each of these $1 bets has earned 50 
cents.
If you can manage 500 flips of the coin per hour, your hourly 
rate is now $250, because on average you will lose one dollar 250
10 Chapter Two
times and win two dollars 250 times. $500 minus $250 equals a 
$250 net win. Notice again that your mathematical expectation, 
which is the amount you will average winning per bet, is 50 cents. 
You have won $250 after betting a dollar 500 times: That works 
out to be 50 cents per bet.
Mathematical expectation has nothing to do with results. The 
imbecile might win the first ten coin flips in a row, but getting 
2-to-l odds on an even-money proposition, you still earn 50 cents 
per $1 bet. It makes no difference whether you win or lose a 
specific bet or series of bets as long as you have a bankroll to 
cover your losses easily. If you continue to make these bets, you 
will win, and in the long run your win will approach specifically 
the sum of your expectations.
Anytime you make a bet with the best of it, where the odds 
are in your favor, you have earned something on that bet, whether 
you actually win or lose the bet. By the same token, when you 
make a bet with the worst of it, where the odds are not in your 
favor, you have lost something, whether you actually win or lose 
the bet.
You have the best of it when you have a positive expectation, 
and you have a positive expectation when the odds are in your 
favor. You have the worst of it when you have a negative 
expectation, and you have a negative expectation when the odds 
are against you. Serious gamblers bet only when they have the 
best of it; when they have the worst of it, they pass.
What does it mean to have the odds in your favor? It means 
winning more on a result than the true odds warrant. The true odds 
of a coin's coming up heads are 1-to-l, but you're getting 2-to-l 
for your money. The odds in this instance are in your favor. You 
have the best of it with a positive expectation of 50 cents per bet.
Here is a slightly more complicated example of mathematical 
expectation. A person writes down a number from one to five and 
bets $5 against your $ 1 that you cannot guess the number. Should 
you take the bet? What is your mathematical expectation?
Four guesses will be wrong, and one will be right, on 
average. Therefore, the odds against your guessing correctly are
Expectation and Hourly Rate 11
4-to-1 • Chances are that in a single try you will lose the dollar, 
However, you are getting $5-to-$ 1 on a 4-to-1 proposition. So the 
odds are in your favor, you have the best of it, and you should 
take the bet. If you make that bet five times, on average you will 
lose $1 four times and win $5 once. You have earned $1 on five 
bets for a positive expectation of 20 cents per bet.
A bettor is taking the odds when he stands to win more than 
he bets, as in the example above. He is laying the odds when he 
stands to win less than he bets. A bettor may have either a positive 
or a negative expectation, whether he is taking the odds or laying 
them. If you lay $50 to win $10 when you are only a 4-to-1 
favorite, you have a negative expectation of $2 per bet, since 
you'll win $10 four times but lose $50 once, on average, for a net 
loss of $ 10 after five bets. On the other hand, if you lay $30 to win 
$ 10 when you're a 4-to-1 favorite, you have a positive expectation 
of $2, since you'll win $10 four times again but lose only $30 
once, for a net profit of $10. Expectation shows that the first bet 
is a bad one and the second bet is a good one.
Mathematical expectation is at the heart of every gambling 
situation. When a bookmaker requires football bettors to lay $11 
to win $10, he has a positive expectation of 50 cents per $10 bet. 
When a casino pays even money on the pass line at the craps 
table, it has a positive expectation of about $1.40 per $100 bet 
since the game is structured so that the pass line bettor will lose 
50.7 percent of the time and win 49.3 percent of the time, on 
average.  Indeed  it  is  this  seemingly  minuscule  positive 
expectation that provides casinos around the world with all their 
enormous profits. As Vegas World casino owner Bob Stupak has 
said, "Having one-thousandth of one percent the worst of it, if he 
plays long enough, that one-thousandth of one percent will bust 
the richest man in the world."
In most gambling situations like casino craps and roulette, the 
odds on any given bet are constant. In others they change, and 
mathematical expectation can show you how to evaluate a 
particular situation. In blackjack, for instance, to determine the 
right play, mathematicians have calculated your expectation
12 Chapter Two
Expectation and Hourly Rate 13
playing a hand one way and your expectation playing it another 
way. Whichever play gives you a higher positive expectation 
or a lower negative expectation is the right one. For example, 
when you have a 16 against the dealer's 10, you're a favorite to 
lose. However, when that 16 is 8,8, your best play is to split 
the 8s, doubling your bet. By splitting the 8s against the dealer's 
10, you still stand to lose more money than you win, but you 
have a lower negative expectation than if you simply hit every 
time you had an 8,8 against a 10.
Mathematical 
Expectation in Poker
Poker plays can also be analyzed in terms of expectation. 
You may think that a particular play is profitable, but sometimes 
it may not be the best play because an alternative play is more 
profitable. Let's say you have a full house in five-card draw. A 
player ahead of you bets. You know that if you raise, that player 
will call. So raising appears to be the best play. However, when 
you raise, the two players behind you will surely fold. On the 
other hand, if you call the first bettor, you feel fairly confident 
that the two players behind you will also call. By raising, you 
gain  one unit, but by only calling you gain two. Therefore, 
calling has  the higher positive expectation and is the better 
play.
Here is a similar but slightly more complicated situation. On 
the last card in a seven-card stud hand, you make a flush. The 
player ahead of you, whom you read to have two pair, bets, and 
there is a player behind you still in the hand, whom you know 
you have beat. If you raise, the player behind you will fold. 
Furthermore, the initial bettor will probably also fold if he in 
fact does have only two pair; but if he made a full house, he 
will reraise. In this instance, then, raising not only gives you 
no positive expectation, but it's actually a play with negative 
expectation. For if the initial bettor has a full house and reraises,
the play costs you two units if you call his reraise and one unit if 
you fold.
Taking this example a step runner: If you do not make the 
flush on the last card and the player ahead of you bets, you might 
raise  against certain opponents! Following the logic of the 
situation when you did make the flush, the player behind you will 
fold, and if the initial bettor has only two pair, he too may fold. 
Whether the play has positive expectation (or less negative 
expectation than folding) depends upon the odds you are getting 
for your money — that is, the size of the pot — and your estimate 
of the chances that the initial bettor does not have a full house and 
will throw away two pair. Making the latter estimate requires, of 
course, the ability to read hands and to read players, which I 
discuss in later chapters. At this level, expectation becomes much 
more complicated than it was when you were just flipping a coin.
Mathematical expectation can also show that one poker play 
is less unprofitable than another. If, for instance, you think you 
will average losing 75 cents, including the ante, by playing a 
hand, you should play on because that is better than folding if the 
ante is a dollar.
Another important reason to understand expectation is that it 
gives you a sense of equanimity toward winning or losing a bet: 
When you make a good bet or a good fold, you will know that you 
have earned or saved a specific amount which a lesser player 
would not have earned or saved. It is much harder to make that 
fold if you are upset because your hand was outdrawn. However, 
the money you save by folding instead of calling adds to your 
winnings for the night or for the month. I actually derive pleasure 
from making a good fold even though I have lost the pot.
Just remember that if the hands were reversed, your opponent 
would call you, and as we shall see when we discuss the 
Fundamental Theorem of Poker in the next chapter, this is one of 
your edges. You should be happy when it occurs. You should 
even derive satisfaction from a losing session when you know that 
other players would have lost much more with your cards.
14 Chapter Two
Hourly Rate
As suggested in the coin-flip example at the opening of this 
chapter, hourly rate is closely related to expectation, and it is a 
concept especially important to the professional player. When you 
go into a poker game, you should try to assess what you think you 
can earn per hour. For the most part you will have to base your 
assessment on your judgment and experience, but you can use 
certain mathematical guidelines. For instance, if you are playing 
draw lowball and you see three players calling $10 and then 
drawing two cards, which is a very bad play, you can say to 
yourself that each time they put in $10 they are losing an average 
of about $2. They are each doing it eight times an hour, which 
means those three players figure to lose about $48 an hour. You 
are one of four other players who are approximately equal, and 
therefore you four players figure to split up that $48 an hour, 
which gives you $12 an hour apiece. Your hourly rate in this 
instance is simply your share of the total hourly loss of the three 
bad players in the game.
Of course, in most games you can't be that precise. Even in 
the example just given, other variables would affect your hourly 
rate. Additionally, when you are playing in a public card room or 
in some private games where the operator cuts the pot, you need 
to deduct either the house rake or the hourly seat charge. In Las 
Vegas card rooms the rake is usually 10 percent of each pot up to 
a maximum of $4 in the smaller seven-card stud games and 5 
percent of each pot to a maximum of $3 in the larger seven-card 
stud games, in the Texas hold 'em games, and in most other 
games.
In the long run a poker player's overall win is the sum of his 
mathematical expectations in individual situations. The more 
plays you make with a positive expectation, the bigger winner you 
stand to be. The more plays you make with a negative 
expectation, the bigger loser you stand to be. Therefore, you 
should almost always try to make the play that will maximize
Expectation and Hourly Rate 15
your positive expectation or minimize your negative expectation 
in order to maximize your hourly rate.
Once you have decided what your hourly rate is, you should 
realize that what you are doing is earning. You are no longer 
gambling in the traditional sense. You should no longer be 
anxious to have a good day or upset when you have a bad day. If 
you play regularly, you should simply feel that it is better to be 
playing poker making $20 an hour, able to come and go as you 
please, than to be working an eight-hour shift making $ 15 an hour. 
To think of poker as something glamorous is very bad. You must 
think that you are just working as a poker player and that you are 
not particularly anxious about making a big score. If it comes, it 
comes. Conversely, you won't be so upset if you have a big loss. 
If one comes, it comes. You are just playing for a certain hourly 
rate.
If you have estimated your hourly rate correctly, your 
eventual winnings will approximate your projected hourly rate 
multiplied by the total hours played. Your edge comes not from 
holding better cards, but from play in situations where your 
opponents would play incorrectly if they had your hand and you 
had theirs. The total amount of money they cost themselves in 
incorrect play, assuming you play perfectly, minus the rake, is the 
amount of money you will win. Your opponents' various mistakes 
per hour will cost them various amounts of money. If the hands 
were reversed, you wouldn't make these mistakes, and this 
difference is your hourly rate. That's all there is to it. If they play 
a hand against you differently from the way you would play it five 
times an hour, and if it's a $2 mistake on average, that's a $10-
an-hour gain for you.
To assume you play perfectly is, of course, a big assumption. 
Few if any of us play perfectly all of the time, but that is what we 
strive for. Furthermore, it is important to realize that there is not 
one particular correct way to play a poker hand as there is in most 
bridge hands. On the contrary, you must adjust to your opponents 
and mix up your play, even against the same opponents, as we 
shall explain in later chapters.
16 Chapter Two
Furthermore, it is sometimes correct to play incorrectly! You 
may, for example, purposely make an inferior play to gain in a 
future hand or future round of betting. You also may play less 
than optimally against weak opponents who have only a limited 
amount to lose or when you yourself are on a short bankroll. In 
these cases it is not correct to push small edges. You should not 
put in the maximum raises as a small favorite. You should fold 
hands that are marginally worth calling. You have reduced your 
hourly rate but have ensured yourself a win. Why give weaker 
players any chance to get lucky and quit big winners or get lucky 
and bust you if you are on a short bankroll? You'll still get the 
money playing less than optimally. It will just take a few more 
hours.
You should try to assess most poker games in terms of your 
expected hourly rate by noticing what mistakes your opponents 
are making and how much these mistakes are costing them. Don't 
sit in a game with an insufficient hourly rate projection unless you 
think the game will become better — either because you expect 
some weaker players to arrive soon or because some good players 
in the game have a tendency to start playing badly when they are 
losing. If these good players jump off winners, you should quit if 
you can. However, it is sometimes good to continue in a game 
with a low hourly rate projection for political reasons — you do 
not want to get a reputation for gambling only when you have 
much the best of it. Such a reputation can make enemies, cost you 
money in the long run, and even get you barred from some games.
Chapter Three  
The Fundamental 
Theorem of Poker
There  is  a  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Algebra  and  a 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. So it's about time to introduce 
the Fundamental Theorem of Poker. Poker, like all card games, is 
a game of incomplete information, which distinguishes it from 
board games like chess, backgammon, and checkers, where you 
can always see what your opponent is doing. If everybody's cards 
were showing at all times, there would always be a precise, 
mathematically correct play for each player. Any player who 
deviated  from  his  correct  play  would  be  reducing  his 
mathematical expectation and increasing the expectation of his 
opponents.
Of course, if all cards were exposed at all times, there 
wouldn't be a game of poker. The art of poker is filling the gaps 
in the incomplete information provided by your opponent's 
betting and the exposed cards in open-handed games, and at the 
same time preventing your opponents from discovering any more 
than what you want them to know about your hand.
That leads us to the Fundamental Theorem of Poker:
Every time you play a hand differently from the way 
you would have played it if you could see all your 
opponents' cards, they gain; and every time you play 
your hand the same way you would have played it if 
you could see all their cards, they lose. Conversely, 
every time opponents play their hands differently 
from the way they would have if they could see all 
your cards, you gain; and every time they play their
17
18 Chapter Three
hands the same way they would have played if they 
could see all your cards, you lose.
The Fundamental Theorem applies universally when a hand 
has been reduced to a contest between you and a single opponent. 
It nearly always applies to multi-way pots as well, but there are 
rare exceptions, which we will discuss at the end of the chapter.
What does the Fundamental Theorem mean? Realize that if 
somehow your opponent knew your hand, there would be a 
correct play for him to make. If, for instance, in a draw poker 
game your opponent saw that you had a pat flush before the draw, 
his correct play would be to throw away a pair of aces when you 
bet. Calling would be a mistake, but it is a special kind of mistake. 
We do not mean your opponent played the hand badly by calling 
with a pair of aces; we mean he played it differently from the way 
he would play it if he could see your cards.
This flush example is very obvious. In fact, the whole 
theorem is obvious, which is its beauty; yet its applications are 
often not so obvious. Sometimes the amount of money in the pot 
makes it correct to call, even if you could see that your opponent's 
hand is better than yours. Let's look at several examples of the 
Fundamental Theorem of Poker in action.
Examples of The 
Fundamental Theorem of Poker
The Fundamental Theorem of Poker 19
This example may also seem too obvious for serious 
discussion,  but it is  a general statement  of  some fairly 
sophisticated plays. Let's say in no-limit hold 'em you hold the
and your opponent holds an offsuit
The flop comes:
Example 1
Suppose your hand is not as good as your opponent's when 
you bet. Your opponent calls your bet, and you lose. But in fact 
you have not lost; you have gained! Why? Because obviously 
your opponent's correct play, if he knew what you had, would be 
to raise. Therefore, you have gained when he doesn't raise, and if 
he folds, you have gained a tremendous amount.
You check, your opponent bets, and you call. Now the ace of 
diamonds comes on fourth street, and you bet, trying to represent 
aces. If your opponent knew what you had, his correct play would 
be to raise you so much it would cost too much to draw to a flush 
or a straight on the last card, and you would have to fold. 
Therefore, if your opponent only calls, you have gained. You have 
gamed not just because you are getting a relatively cheap final 
card but because your opponent did not make the correct play. 
Obviously if your opponent folds, you have gained tremendously 
since he has thrown away the best hand.
20 Chapter Three
Example 2
Suppose there is $80 in the pot, and you have two pair. You 
are playing draw poker, and you bet $10, which we will assume 
is all you can bet. Your single opponent has a  four-flush — that is, 
four cards to a flush. The question is — are you rooting for him to 
call or fold? Naturally you want him to do what is most profitable 
for you. The Fundamental Theorem of Poker states that what is 
most profitable for you is for your opponent to make the incorrect 
play based on complete information about both hands. Since your 
opponent is getting 9-to-1 odds (his $10 call might win him $90) 
and is only about a 5-to-1 underdog to make a flush, it is correct 
for him to call because a call has positive expectation. Since it is 
correct for him to call, following the Fundamental Theorem, you 
are therefore rooting for him to fold.
This sort of situation comes up frequently. You have the best 
hand, but your opponent is getting odds good enough to make it 
correct to call if he knew what you had. Therefore, you want your 
opponent to fold. By the same token, it is correct for you to chase 
when you are getting sufficient pot odds. If you don't chase, you 
are costing yourself money and, therefore, making money for your 
opponent.
Example 3
Since it is correct for your opponent to call when he is getting 
sufficient pot odds, you can sometimes make an opponent fold 
incorrectly by showing more strength than you actually have on 
an early betting round. Suppose in seven-card stud you bet with:
The Fundamental Theorem of Poker 21
An opponent calls with:
You are fairly sure he has kings. You now proceed to make a pair 
of 6s on board, and you bet. Your opponent will almost certainly 
fold a pair of kings since he is afraid you have made aces up.
Some people might say, "Well, wait a second. Why don't I 
want my opponent to call as long as his pair of kings is worse than 
my two small pair?" The answer is that if there are cards to come 
and your opponent is getting proper odds, you do better to win the 
pot right there. A pair of kings versus two smaller pair needs very 
short odds to justify a call. Since your opponent would have been 
correct to call, you gain when you make him fold.
Example 4
In razz, a seven-card stud lowball game in which the lowest 
hand wins, we can see another example of showing more strength 
than you have to make an opponent fold incorrectly. Let's say 
your opponent has
22 Chapter Three
showing, and you have something like
The Fundamental Theorem of 
Poker 23
You
If you think your opponent has a four-card 8 — and you have a 
pair and only a four-card 8-7 — it is important to bet, even though 
you know you will be called. The bet gains you some extra equity, 
should you happen to catch a little card on sixth street, giving you 
an 8-7 low. If your opponent catches a big card or a pair, still 
having a draw to a better 8 than yours, he will fold, since your 
previous bet indicated you had an 8 made already. The little card 
you've now caught suggests you have made a 7 low, which makes 
your opponent think he is drawing dead — that is, drawing with 
no chance of winning.
Notice that once again you want your opponent to fold even 
though you have the best hand. You have an 8,7 low and are 
drawing to a 7, while all your opponent has is a draw to a better 
8. However, you gain by his folding because, had he known you 
had only an 8,7, he would be getting proper odds to call in the 
hope of drawing out on you. By not calling he made a mistake, 
and you have gained. (You gain even more when that sixth street 
card makes you two pair, and your opponent folds the best hand.)
Example 5
Just as you are rooting for an opponent to fold when he is 
getting sufficient pot odds, you are rooting for him to call when 
he is getting insufficient pot odds. Thus, it is frequently correct to 
play a strong hand weakly on an early round — the converse of 
your plays in the previous two examples — so that your opponent 
will make a bad call when you do improve. Look at the following 
two hands from seven-card razz:
Opponent
A good play against some people with this hand would be to 
check and just call if your opponent bets. Many players would 
now put you on a pair or a bad card in the hole. If you do catch a 
4, 5 or 7 on board, giving you a 6 or 7 low, your opponent will 
probably still call, even if he is drawing dead, because your earlier 
play along with his pot odds make him think it's worth a call. This 
is exactly what you are hoping for. Your deceptive play early has 
caused your opponent to make an incorrect play on a later round.
Example 6
Any time an opponent is not getting close to proper odds 
against you, you are rooting for him to call, even if by calling he 
has a chance of drawing out on you. If in the flush example at the 
beginning of this chapter, the pot were $20 instead of $80, you 
would be rooting for your opponent with the four-flush to call 
your $10 bet because he is a 5-to-1 underdog getting only 3-to-1 
for his money. If he calls and makes a flush, those are the breaks. 
Nevertheless, his play is incorrect because it has negative 
expectation, and you gain any time he makes it.
24 Chapter Three
When you have a hand that is rooting for a call, you should 
not try to make your opponent fold by betting an exorbitant 
amount in a no-limit or pot-limit game. Such a situation came up 
one day when I was playing no-limit hold 'em. There was one 
card to come, and I had a straight which, at that point, was the 
nuts — that is, the best possible hand. I bet something like $50, 
the player to my left called, and the player behind him called the 
$50 and raised the rest of his money, which was about $200.
Since I had the best possible hand, the question was, should 
I raise or just call? There was something like $500 in the pot. 
Because the third man was all-in, I only had to think about the 
man behind me. I knew if I reraised, say, $400, making it $600 to 
him, he definitely would fold; in fact, if I raised almost any 
amount he would fold. But if I just called the $200, he would 
probably call.
What did I want him to do? I was pretty sure he had two pair. 
If I called the $200, there would be about $700 in the pot, which 
would give him 7-to-2 odds to call $200 with his two pair. 
However, the odds against his making a full house with two pair 
were 10-to-1 (there were 40 cards in the deck that didn't help him 
and 4 that did). Therefore, if he knew I had a straight, it would be 
incorrect for him to take 7-to-2 odds on a 10-to-l shot. So I just 
called the $200, and as I expected and wanted, he did too.
The sad conclusion to this story is that he made a full house 
and bet a very small amount, which I paid off. Many people 
argued I had been wrong to let him in rather than raise him out, 
but in fact they are wrong. I had to give him a chance to make a 
mistake, which he did, because whenever my opponent makes a 
mistake, I gain in the long run.
"Mistakes" According to The 
Fundamental Theorem of Poker
It is very important to understand that when we talk about 
making a mistake according to the Fundamental Theorem of
The Fundamental Theorem of Poker 25
poker, we're not necessarily talking about playing badly. We're 
talking about a very strange kind of mistake—playing differently 
from the way you would if you could see all your opponents' 
cards. If I have a royal flush and someone has a king-high straight 
flush, that player is making a mistake to call me. But a player 
surely cannot be accused of playing badly by calling or, as is 
much more likely, raising with a king-high straight flush. Since he 
doesn't know what I have, he is making a mistake in a different 
sense of the word.
In advanced poker you are constantly trying to make your 
opponent or opponents play in a way that would be incorrect if 
they knew what you had. Anytime they play in the right way on 
the basis of what you have, you have not gained a thing. 
According to the Fundamental Theorem of Poker, you play 
winning poker by playing as closely as possible to the way you 
would play if you could see all your opponents' cards; and you try 
to make your opponents play as far away from this Utopian level 
as possible. The first goal is accomplished mainly by reading 
hands and players accurately, because the closer you can come to 
figuring out someone else's hand, the fewer Fundamental 
Theorem  mistakes  you  will  make.  The  second  goal  is 
accomplished by playing deceptively.
Multi-Way Pots
We stated at the start of the chapter that the Fundamental 
Theorem of Poker applies to all two-way pots and to nearly all 
multi-way pots. The reason we qualify multi-way pots is that there 
are certain situations with two or more opponents when you 
actually want one or more of them to play as they would if they 
knew what you had. Let's say that with cards still to come, you 
have a 30 percent chance of winning a pot. Opponent A has a 50 
Percent chance, and Opponent В has a 20 percent chance. If you 
bet, you might not mind Opponent A's raising with the best hand 
to force Opponent В out. A's chances of winning may now 
increase to 60 percent, but yours increase to 40 percent. You have
26 Chapter Three
both profited at the expense of С You might, for example, bet a 
pair of aces. Opponent A has two pair, and Opponent В has a 
straight draw. You'd like Opponent A to know you have only 
aces, not aces up, so that he will raise and drive the straight draw 
out. You would be getting good enough odds to call the raise and 
at the same time wouldn't have to worry about Opponent B's 
drawing a straight.
Summary
The Fundamental Theorem of Poker states that the best way 
for players to play is the way they would play if they knew their 
opponent's cards. Anytime a player sees an opponent's cards 
when the hand is over and says, "Oh, if I'd known that's what he 
had, I would have played differently," that player has cost himself 
money and made (or saved) money for his opponents.
Chapter Four  
The Ante Structure
All poker starts as a struggle for the antes. If there were no 
ante, there would be no reason to play. It's true that some players 
would play anyway, but a good player in such a game would 
simply wait for the pure nuts and nearly always win. A good 
player would have no reason to play anything but big starter hands 
— three aces, say, in seven-card stud — because with no money 
yet in the pot, there would be nothing to shoot for. To play with 
anything less would be to risk getting picked off by someone else 
who played nothing but the pure nuts. If all players in the game 
played nothing but the pure nuts, there could be no game. Any 
time one person bet, everyone else would fold. Obviously, then, 
there has to be an ante to establish a game.
On the other hand, if the ante were ridiculously large in 
relation to the betting limits, the game would pretty much 
deteriorate into a crap shoot. It would be like someone walking by 
a $5-$ 10 game and tossing a $100 bill on the table saying, "Play 
for it, boys." With that big an initial pot, in which you would be 
getting at least 21-to-l odds on your first $5 call, it would be 
worth playing just about any hand right to the end.
These two extremes — no ante and an absurdly high ante — 
suggest a general principle of play. The lower the ante in 
comparison to future bets, the fewer hands you should play; the 
higher the ante, the more hands you should play. A different way 
of looking at it is: The lower the ante, the higher your starting 
requirements should be, and the higher the ante, the lower your 
starting requirements should be. Or in the language of the poker 
room: The lower the ante, the tighter you should play; the higher 
the ante, the looser you should play. I consider 5 percent or less of 
the average future bets a small ante and 15 percent or more of the 
average future bets a large ante. Anything in between is an
27
28 Chapter Four
average ante. Thus, $100 would be an average ante in a 
$l,000-$2,000 game, while in a $5-$ 10 game, 50 cents would be 
an average ante.
The antes are not always the only things that make up the 
initial pot. There may be forced bets, or blinds — forced bets that 
rotate around the table from hand to hand. In Las Vegas 
seven-card stud, for example, the low card on board starts the 
action with a small bet. In most $l-$2, $l-$3, and $l-$4 stud 
games the forced bet (50 cents) actually replaces the ante. In razz 
the high card starts the action with a small bet. And in hold 'em 
there is almost always at least one and sometimes two or even 
three blinds. When we talk about antes in this chapter, we are 
including any forced bets or blinds.
To repeat, all poker starts as a struggle for the ante. This 
struggle for the antes is what determines all future action. It is a 
struggle that increases and builds up, but it should never be 
forgotten that the initial struggle for the antes is what started the 
war. Players who do forget this, no matter how well they play 
otherwise, frequently find themselves in trouble. Most often they 
play too many hands in relation to the size of the ante; sometimes 
they play too few.
The best way to evaluate the size of the ante is to think about 
it in terms of pot odds and expectation. Let's say you sit down in 
an eight-handed $10-$20 game, and everybody antes $1. That 
creates an $8 pot. Starting with that $8, you should play your hand 
in terms of the odds you're getting for each bet in relation to your 
expectation of winning. If you bet $10, you are laying $10 to win 
$8. If someone calls you, he is getting $18-to-$10.
The fact that $1 or one-eighth of that ante money was 
originally yours is of no consequence. In truth, it is no longer 
yours. The moment you place your $ 1 ante in the pot, it belongs 
to the pot, not to you, and eventually to the winner of the hand. It 
is a common fallacy for players to think in terms of the money 
they have already put in the pot. They make a bad call because 
they called one or two bets on earlier rounds. However, it is 
absolutely irrelevant whether you put the money in there or
The Ante Structure 29
someone else did. It is the total amount, no part of which belongs 
to you any longer, that should determine how you play your hand. 
In home games the dealer often antes for everybody. Some 
players play much more loosely when they are dealing, thinking 
that the ante is somehow theirs. But to play differently just 
because you anted, rather than someone else, is absurd. It is the 
same amount of money out there, no matter from whose stack of 
chips it came.
On the other hand, when you have the blind in hold 'em, for 
example, you can and should play a little looser, not because that 
blind is yours, but because you're getting better pot odds. A single 
example should make this clear. Let's say you have the $5 blind 
in hold 'em, and someone behind you raises it to $10. It now costs 
everyone else $10 to call, but when it comes back around to you, 
it costs you only $5. If the pot grows to $35, someone calling the 
$ 10 would be getting 31/2-to-1, but since it's only $5 to you, you're 
getting 7-to-l for your money. So you don't need quite so strong 
a hand to justify a call. You are considering your present pot odds, 
not the $5 you already have in the pot.
Large Antes
The size of the ante in a particular game determines how you 
play. The larger the ante in comparison to later bets, the more 
hands you should play. Since there's more money in the pot, 
you're obviously getting better odds, but there are other reasons 
for playing more loosely. Should you wait to get an extremely 
good hand in a high ante game, you'll have lost more than the size 
of the pot in antes by the time you win a pot. Furthermore, the 
pots you do win will be comparatively small because the other 
Players, if they are decent players, will notice you are playing 
very tight and won't give you much action when you do play a 
hand. In fact, when you do get action, you're very likely to be 
beat.
As the antes go up, your opponents reduce their playing 
requirements, and unless you want to be eaten up by the antes,
30 Chapter Four
you too must reduce your playing requirements. These lower 
requirements continue to the next round of betting and progress 
right on to the end of the hand. In a large-ante game you might bet 
for value marginal hands you would throw away in a small-ante 
game. The principle holds true especially in head-up situations. In 
a large-ante seven stud game you might see two good players 
betting and calling right up to the last card, and then at the end 
one of them bets a pair of 7s for value and gets called by his 
opponent with a pair of 5s. As it happens, though, larger antes 
tend to make multi-way pots more numerous since more players 
are getting good pot odds to draw to a big hand. With many 
players in the pot, drawing hands (like four-flushes and open-end 
straights) go up in value, while mediocre pairs like those 7s and 
5s go down in value.
Another  reason  for  loosening  up  when  the  ante  is 
comparatively high is that if you are playing too tight, it becomes 
correct for other players to try to steal the ante from you without 
any kind of a hand. I've been in games where some players played 
too tight for the ante. When they were the only players in the pot, 
I knew I could try to steal the antes, no matter what I had. Let's 
say it costs me $7 to raise the pot in order to try to steal $10 in 
antes. That is, I put in $7, hoping the remaining players will fold. 
I figure I will get away with the play approximately 60 percent of 
the time. Since I need to be successful only about 41 percent of 
the time to show a profit, I can try to steal with anything. The 
point is you cannot play too tightly for the antes unless you want 
to give up this edge to your opponents. To the contrary, as the 
ante increases, you yourself should try to steal more antes, 
especially if you are up against tight players.
If it makes sense to try to win antes right away when they are 
large, it makes abundant sense not to slowplay a good hand.1 The 
reason is that if you don't raise with a good hand on the first
1 Slowplaying, or sandbagging, is playing a strong hand 
weakly in a round of betting to induce a call by a worse hand in 
the later rounds. (See also Chapter Fifteen.)
The Ante Structure 31
round, you are giving an opponent with a mediocre hand the 
chance to come in cheaply and possibly draw out on you. With a 
large ante, he is not making a mistake on the basis of the 
Fundamental Theorem of Poker because he is getting good odds. 
In other words, if a player is getting 8-to-l odds or 10-to-l odds 
on that first round, it is worth it for him to come in and hope to 
catch a perfect card on the next round — even when he is pretty 
sure you are slowplaying a big hand. However, when you raise, 
you wreck the odds he is getting, and he has to throw away his 
mediocre hand. With almost any good hand, it is not worth letting 
opponents in cheaply when the ante gets up there. You are 
satisfied with winning only the antes. On the other hand, when the 
ante is low, it becomes more reasonable to slowplay big hands in 
order to suck worse hands in; you want to get more value for your 
big hands.
Let us summarize this discussion of games with large antes 
before moving on to small-ante games.
1. As the ante increases, you loosen up your starting-hand 
requirements. There are four reasons for you to loosen up. 
First, you are getting better pot odds. Second, it costs too 
much money in antes to wait for big hands. Third, your 
opponents are playing weaker hands. And finally, when you 
play too tight against observant opponents, they will give you 
no action when you do get a big hand.
2. As the ante increases, you loosen up on later rounds, too, 
because the initial weaker requirements carry over into later 
rounds. However, in multi-way pots, hands like mediocre 
pairs decrease in value while drawing hands increase in 
value.
3. As the ante increases, you try to steal antes, especially 
against tight players, because the play has good positive 
expectation.
32 Chapter Four
4. As the ante increases, you raise with a good hand rather than 
try to slowplay it because a large ante makes it likely your 
opponents are getting their proper odds when you do not 
raise and let them in cheaply. Furthermore, when the ante is 
large, opponents may even call your raise when they are not 
getting proper odds, which, according to the Fundamental 
Theorem, is exactly what you want. They are even more 
likely to call your raise if they suspect you have been stealing 
antes with your raises on previous hands.
Small Antes
Not playing loose enough in high-ante games is a much less 
common problem among poker players than playing too loose in 
low-ante and average-ante games. When players in a game cry 
out, "Here comes a live one," what they mean is, "Here comes a 
player who plays too many pots, who always wants to get into the 
action, who doesn't consider the odds before calling, who calls to 
the end with next to nothing when two aces are staring him in the 
face." Put more succinctly, what they mean is, "Here comes a
sucker."
What happens when you play too loose for the ante? Well, 
even if you play very well from then on, you have the problem of 
playing a worse hand on average than your opponents who are 
playing correctly according to the ante. Consequently, you figure 
to lose to them as long as they play as well as you. Even if they 
don't play quite as well as you, you figure to lose to them because 
their starting requirements are higher than yours, and so the hands 
they play against you will, on average, be better than yours.
There used to be a no-limit hold 'em game with a very small 
ante in Las Vegas, and there were a couple of excellent players in 
the game. But they insisted on raising almost every pot before the 
flop, not to steal the small antes, but just to get more money in the 
pot since they felt they could outplay everybody else from that 
point on. However, when a mediocre player who simply played 
tight came into the game, they found they couldn't beat  him. What
The Ante Structure 33
was happening, of course, was that the hands they played were on 
average much worse than the mediocre player's, and even a world 
champion with a pair of kings is an underdog against a nobody 
with a pair of aces. No matter how great a player is, if he plays 
much too loose for the ante, he is giving away an edge to those 
players who play correctly for the ante.
With a small ante, you should play just the opposite of the 
way you would play with a large ante. You play fewer hands, you 
steal fewer antes, and you slowplay big hands to draw people in. 
Let the aggressive players control the game if they choose to. Let 
them steal the antes. Give them a false sense of security. Then, 
when you are in a pot against them, your hand will be so much 
stronger than theirs on average that you'll win any antes they 
might have stolen from you and much more.
As long as you play tight in a small-ante game most of the 
time, it will be possible for you too to steal antes occasionally. 
However, when you are called or reraised, especially by players 
you know to be tight, you must give up on your bluff immediately 
since you are up against too big a hand.
The general rule is that as the ante decreases, you must 
tighten up. But when you are at least as good as or better than 
your opponents in a game with a very low ante, you should not 
tighten up so much that you never seem to play a hand. As the 
ante gets to a very low level, there is a limit to how much you 
should tighten up, because you need to give yourself the chance 
to outplay weaker opponents in later rounds. As the best player in 
the game, you want to play as many hands as possible to allow 
yourself to use your full arsenal of weapons.
Some games have a small ante and also a small initial bet. In 
such cases you should play loose for the initial bet only, calling 
with a marginal hand but folding on the next round of betting if 
your hand has not improved. When you do develop a hand, your 
small investment will pay big dividends. There is a $3-$6 game in 
Nevada with a tiny dime ante. Tight players think they have a 
gold mine in this game, but against decent players they don't. The 
reason is that the first bet is only 50 cents. It's worth playing a
34 Chapter Four
marginal hand to see one card for half a dollar in the hope of 
making a hand that will win a big pot. While the immediate pot 
odds may not justify the call, the implied odds you're getting, 
which are explained in detail in Chapter Seven, do justify it. You 
can call that half-dollar 20 times without improving your hand, 
but if, when you make a hand, you get just one opponent to call 
you to the end, you stand to win more than twice what you had to 
pay for those 20 hands that did not improve. Remember, however, 
to resist any temptation you may have to continue calling when 
your hand has not improved on fourth street.
Summary
The concepts discussed in this chapter may be summed up in 
a few sentences. All poker begins as a struggle for the antes. The 
size of the ante determines the way you play to a large extent, 
because if you don't struggle properly for the antes, you cost 
yourself money one way or the other — either by playing too 
many hands when there's a small ante or too few when there's a 
large ante. With a low ante you should play tight (except in the 
cases noted above), and as the ante increases, you should loosen 
up.
Chapter Five  
Pot Odds
Pot odds are the odds the pot is giving you for calling a bet. 
If there is $50 in the pot and the final bet was $10, you are getting 
5-to-1 odds for your call. It is essential to know pot odds to figure 
out expectation. In the example just given, if you figure your 
chances of winning are better than 5-to-1, then it is correct to call. 
If you think your chances are worse than 5-to-1, you should fold.
Calling on the Basis of Pot 
Odds When All the Cards are Out
When all the cards are out, you must decide whether your 
hand is worth a call, and that depends upon the odds you are 
getting from the pot and what you think of your chances of having 
the best hand. It is a judgment problem more than a math problem 
because there is no way to calculate your chances of winning 
precisely. If you can beat only a bluff, you have to evaluate the 
chances that your opponent is bluffing. When you have a decent 
hand, you must evaluate the chances that your opponent is betting 
a worse hand than yours. Making these evaluations is often not 
easy, especially when you have a marginal hand like two pair in 
seven-card stud. Your ability to do so depends upon your 
experience, especially your ability to read hands and players. 
Some things can be learned only through trials by fire at the poker 
table.

36 Chapter Five
Pot Odds 37
Calling on the Basis of Pot 
Odds With More Cards to Come
What about deciding whether to call before the draw in draw 
poker and in stud games when there is one card to come? Now the 
math becomes important. If you know you have to improve your 
hand to win, you have to determine your chances of improving in 
comparison to your pot odds. With a flush draw or an open-ended 
straight draw — we'll assume the game is five-card draw poker— 
you would be correct to call a $10 bet when the pot is $50 since 
your chance of making the flush or the straight is better than 5-to-
1. Specifically, the odds of making the flush are 4.22-to-l against 
and the odds of making the straight, 4.88-to-l against.
Figuring the odds for making a hand is done on the basis of 
the number of unseen cards and the number among them that will 
make the hand. In five-card draw there are 47 unseen cards — the 
52 in the deck minus the five cards in your hand. If you are 
holding four of a suit, nine of the 47 unseen cards will give you a 
flush and 38 won't. Thus, the odds against making the flush are 
38-to-9, which reduces to 4.22-to-l. If you are holding, say
then eight of the 47 unseen cards will make the straight — four 8s 
and four kings — while 39 of the cards won't help, which reduces 
to 4.88-to-l. When a joker or bug is used, as in public card rooms 
in California, you have an additional card to use to make flushes 
and straights, which improves the chances of making the flush to 
3.8-to-l and of making the straight to 4.33-to-l. With a joker in 
your hand, the chances of making a straight improve dramatically;
any 6, 7, jack, or queen makes the straight, reducing the odds to 
exactly 2-to-l against. Sixteen cards make the hand, and 32 don't.
The smaller the pot odds vis-a-vis the chances of making 
your hand, the more reason you have to fold. With only $30 in the 
pot instead of $50, calling a $10 bet for a flush draw or a straight 
draw (assuming you do not have a joker in your hand) becomes 
incorrect — that is, it becomes a wager with negative expectation 
— unless the implied odds are very large, as they might be in a 
no-limit or pot-limit game.
It is because of the pot odds that people say you need at least 
three other players in the pot to make it worth paying to draw to 
a flush in draw poker. With the antes in there, the pot odds are 
about 4-to-1, and when the bug is used, your chances of making 
the flush are 3.8-to-l. Notice, incidentally, the effect of the antes. 
The higher they are, the better the pot odds, and the easier it is to 
call with a flush draw. On the other hand, with no ante and three 
other players in the pot, you'd be getting only 3-to-1 if you called 
a bet before the draw, and so you'd have to fold a four-flush.
Exposed Cards
There is one aspect of comparing the odds of making your 
hand to your pot odds that is frequently overlooked in open-
handed games like stud poker and razz: The effect on your play 
of the cards exposed in other players' hands, which of course 
includes cards that were folded along with those still out against
instead of having eight or nine cards to help your hand, you might 
have 12 or even 16. For example, if you are holding
38 Chapter Five
you. For instance, it would be crazy to play a pair of 5s in 
seven-card stud with the two other 5s exposed.
Your chances of improving a hand change dramatically 
according to the number of needed cards that are gone and the 
total number of cards exposed. The second factor is important. For 
example, with three spades on your first three cards and no other 
cards seen, you will make a spade flush in seven cards 18 percent 
of the time. Now, suppose when you look around the table, you 
see that exactly one of your seven opponents shows a spade. What 
does this do to your chances of making a flush? If you say it 
increases them, you are right. True, one of your needed cards is 
gone, but so too are six unneeded cards. Therefore, there are more 
spades proportionally among the unseen cards than you would 
assume if you had seen no cards at all.
Generally, though, it's not so much the total number of 
exposed cards that people ignore but the number of cards among 
them that they need. It is very important to pay attention to these 
cards because their presence can change a playable hand into an 
unplayable one. Let's say you start with three spades on your first 
three cards in seven-card stud, and you have seen seven other 
cards. The following table shows the effect of the other cards on 
your making a flush.

Position
Just as the number of needed cards you see reduces your 
chances of improving your hand, your position in the sequence of 
betting may also reduce the pot odds you are getting. If a player 
ahead of you bets and there is a possible raise to your left, you 
must be cognizant of the fact that that possibility cuts down on 
your odds. If, for example, there is a $100 pot and the bet is $20, 
you appear to be getting 6-to-1 odds ($120 to $20). However, 
when there is a raiser behind you and the original bettor calls, you 
are really getting only 41/2-to-l if you call the raise. Although the 
pot has grown to $180, you must put in a total of $40. If the 
original bettor reraises, your odds drop to 32/3-to-1. The pot grows 
to $220 (assuming the opponent behind you calls the reraise), but 
you have to put in $60. What's more, your chances of winning, 
even when you make your hand, have certainly decreased with all 
that raising going on between your opponents, suggesting they 
have pretty big hands.
42 Chapter Five
How does the concept of position vis-a-vis pot odds work in 
practice? Let's say in seven-card stud you have a four-flush in six 
cards and a player to your right bets after pairing his door card. 
(The door card is the first open card the player receives. When it 
is paired on board, trips, or three-of-a-kind, is a strong possibility 
since the player may have started with a pair.) At the same time 
that the player with the open pair bets, you notice that a player to 
your left has caught a card that looks as if it has made him a 
straight. Before you call the first bet, you must be aware that the 
player to your left may raise if he made a straight (or even if he 
didn't). Furthermore, the original bettor may reraise with three-
of-a-kind or, of course, a full house. So before calling the first 
bet, you have to assess your pot odds not just at the moment but 
in the event there is a raise or two behind you. You also have to 
decide what your chances of winning are if you do make the 
flush. You would, of course, beat the straight, but the question is 
whether the original bettor is the kind of player who would bet 
into a possible straight with less than a full house or at the very 
least three-of-a-kind.
Adjusting your pot odds before calling a bettor to your right 
with players behind you comes up most often in games like 
five-card draw, draw lowball, and hold 'em, where position is 
important. Let's say in hold 'em you hold the
and the flop comes
Pot Odds 43
You would seem to have a strong hand with the top pair, but if 
you are in second position with a number of players behind you 
and the player in first position bets, you should probably throw 
away your aces. Not only has the player in first position suggested 
a great deal of strength with his bet, but he may get raised by such 
hands as an ace-king,  асе-queen, and three-of-a-kind, which 
shortens your pot odds and further decreases the possibility of 
your ending up with the best hand. Additionally, the chance of 
calls from flush draws and straight draws behind you further 
diminishes the strength of your pair of aces. You face the 
uncomfortable double possibility of being second-best at the 
moment and of being outdrawn on the last two cards.
Similarly, in seven-card stud you might have to throw away 
a pair of jacks in the hole if the player representing queens to your 
immediate right bets. Not only do you figure to be second-best to 
the queens, but someone behind you might raise, thus reducing 
your pot odds and chances of winning. On the other hand, you'd 
probably call the bet in a late position, especially because of the 
deceptive value of your hidden pair, if you happen to catch 
another jack. (For a full discussion of the importance of position, 
see Chapter Seventeen.)
Extra Outs
Just as many players overlook the effects of position and 
exposed cards to lower the value of a hand, so too do they 
sometimes overlook extra outs to increase the value of a hand. An 
out is a way of improving your hand. With four hearts your only 
out is another heart. But suppose you have two pair along with the 
four-flush against what looks like aces up. Now you have two outs 
making a flush and a full house. Suppose you have a four-flush, 
two pair, and an inside straight draw. Now you have three outs 
— that is, three ways of beating your opponent with the aces up, 
assuming that player doesn't fill. Each extra out increases the 
value of your hand, and it increases it considerably more than may 
at first be apparent. Starting off with a two-flush and a pair in
44 Chapter Five
seven-card stud is significantly better than starting with a pair and 
no two-flush. In hold 'em, a back-door straight (that is, a possible 
straight requiring two perfect cards at the end) or a back-door 
flush draw along with a pair may be enough to change a fold to a 
call.
To see how much effect these extra outs have, let's say we 
assess our hand as a 7-to-l underdog. Now we notice we have an 
extra out that is about 20-to-l against coming in. By itself that 
extra out is a long shot, but it adds tremendously to our chances 
of  improving.  Changing  those  7-to-l  and  20-to-l  odds  to 
percentages, we have а 121/2 percent chance and about a 5 percent 
chance, which, added together, comes to approximately 171/2 
percent. Returning from percentages to odds, we see that the extra 
out has dropped us from a 7-to-1 underdog to a 43/4-to-1 underdog. 
With pot odds of, say, 5-to-1 or 6-to-1, a hand we would have 
folded now becomes one worth playing. Always be aware of extra 
outs. Otherwise you may fold hands with which you should have 
called.
Drawing to the 
Second-Best Hand
Equally important in determining whether a hand that needs 
improvement is worth a call is the question of whether the hand 
will win even if you do make it. Your hand might lose in a variety 
of ways. It can happen because you are drawing dead — that is, 
the hand you are looking to make is already beaten by your 
opponent. For example, when that open pair bet into your four-
flush and a possible straight earlier in this chapter, he might have 
been betting a full house, which you have no way of beating. It 
can also happen that you make your hand and your opponent 
makes an even better hand even though you weren't drawing 
dead. Your four-flush might, for example, be up against three-
of-a-kind. You may make your flush, but your opponent may 
very well make a full house.
Pot Odds 45
In such situations you must reduce your odds of winning and 
sometimes throw your hand away. For instance, a four-flush 
against three-of-a-kind in seven-card stud is a much greater 
underdog than a four-flush against two pair because three-
of-a-kind is more than twice as likely to improve to a full house. 
The ability to fold correctly when you suspect you are drawing 
dead or drawing with too little chance of ending up with the best 
hand is one attribute that distinguishes a good player from  an 
average one. On the other hand, poor players are likely to call 
thoughtlessly on the come no matter what. They do not consider 
that they may be drawing dead; and when they're not drawing 
dead, they do not adjust their chances of ending up with the best 
hand, taking into account the possibility of an opponent's making 
a bigger hand than their own.
In hold 'em and other community card games, you can 
sometimes draw dead because the cards that will give you the 
hand you want will also give your opponent an even better hand. 
Suppose in hold 'em you are holding
your opponent is holding
46 Chapter Five
and the board is
If a queen falls on the end, you make a straight, to be sure, and a 
straight beats three jacks. However, the queen also happens to 
give your opponent a full house. Similarly, if you hold
Pot Odds 47
feel there is a 30 percent chance your opponent will make a hand 
that beats the one you are trying to make. Should you still call? As 
a 5-to-1 underdog you are going to make your hand one-sixth of 
the time, which is 16% percent. However, of that 16% percent of 
the time, you will be good only 70 percent of the time. All of a 
sudden, instead of winning 162/3 percent of the time, you will win 
only about 112/3 percent of the time. You go from a 5-to-1 shot to 
just about a 71/2-to-1 shot. What appeared to be an easy call has 
become a fold.
In general, you don't need to calculate your chances of 
winning so precisely; when there is a chance of drawing dead or 
being outdrawn after you make your hand, you had better throw 
away most of your close plays because they will swing into losing 
plays. You have to overcome the double adversity of having the 
worst hand in the first place and the possibility of not winning 
when you make the hand you are hoping to make. To call a bet in 
such a situation requires very good pot odds indeed.
there is no card in the deck that will make you a winner against an 
opponent holding the ace of hearts and another heart. A heart at 
the end gives you a king-high flush, but it gives your opponent an 
ace-high flush.
When you think your opponent might beat you even if you 
make your hand, you must adjust your odds of winning before 
comparing them to the pot odds you are getting. Let's say you are 
a 5-to-1 underdog to make your hand, and you are getting 7-to-l 
from the pot. By itself your hand is worth a call. But suppose you
Summary
In this chapter we have explained how to use pot odds to 
determine whether to call or fold with a likely second-best hand. 
When all the cards are out, your hand is worth a call if you think 
your chances of winning are better than your pot odds. Before the 
draw in draw poker and with exactly one card to come in stud 
games, your decision to call with a hand that needs to improve 
depends upon these factors: 1 •    Your chances of improving, 
taking into account the needed
cards already out against you (in stud) and any extra outs you
might have.
2.    Your chances of winning if you do improve. 3.    The odds 
you are getting on this next-to-last round of betting,
taking into account the possibility of a raise behind you if
you are not the last to act.
and the board is
48 Chapter Five
4.    Your expected extra profits on the last round of betting if you 
do make your hand.
This last factor is what I call implied odds. It is the money 
you expect to win by betting or raising on the last round (or 
rounds) when you do make your hand. I will discuss implied odds 
in full in Chapter Seven. First we must consider how pot odds are 
affected when you are deciding whether to call in stud games 
when there is more than one card to come and you must anticipate 
having to call more than one round of betting. This question is the 
subject of the next chapter.
Chapter Six  
Effective Odds
When there is only one round of betting left and only one 
card to come, comparing your chances of improving to the pot 
odds you are getting is a relatively straightforward proposition. If 
your chances of making a hand you know will win are, say, 4-to-1 
against and you must call a $20 bet for the chance to win a $120 
pot, then clearly your hand is worth a call because you're getting 
6-to-1 pot odds. Those 6-to-1 odds the pot is offering you 
(excluding bets on the end) are greater than the 4-to-1 odds 
against your making your hand. However, when there is more 
than one card to come, you must be very careful in determining 
your real pot odds. Many players make a classic mistake: They 
know their chances of improving, let's say, with three cards to 
come, and they compare those chances to the pot odds they are 
getting right now. But such a comparison is completely off the 
mark since the players are going to have to put more money into 
the pot in future betting rounds, and they must take that money 
into account. It's true that the chances of making a hand improve 
greatly when there are two or three cards to come, but the odds 
you are getting from the pot worsen.
Reducing Your Pot Odds 
With More than One Card to Come
Let's say you are playing hold 'em, and after the flop you 
have a four-flush that you are sure will win if you hit it. There 
are two cards to come, which improves your odds of making the 
flush to approximately 13/4-to-l. It is a $10-$20 game with $20 
in the pot, and your single opponent has bet $10. You may 
say, "I'm getting 3-to-1 odds and my chances are l3/4-to-l. So I 
should call."
49
50 Chapter Six
However, the 13/4-to-1 odds of making the flush apply only if you 
intend to see not just the next card, but the last card as well, and 
to see the last card you will probably have to call not just $ 10 now 
but also $20 on the next round of betting. Therefore, when you 
decide you're going to see a hand that needs improvement all the 
way through to the end, you can't say you are getting, as in this 
case, 30-to-10 odds. You have to say, "Well, if I miss my hand, I 
lose $ 10 on this round of betting and $20 on the next round. In all, 
I lose $30. If I make my hand, I will win the $30 in there now plus 
$20 on the next round for a total of $50." All of a sudden, instead 
of 30-to-10, you're getting only 50-to-30 odds, which reduces to 
l2/3-to-l.
These are your effective odds — the real odds you are getting 
from the pot when you call a bet with more than one card to come. 
Since you are getting only 12/3-to-l by calling a $10 bet after the 
flop, and your chances of making the flush are 1%-to-l, you 
would have to throw away the hand, because it has turned into a 
losing play — that is, a play with negative expectations. The only 
time it would be correct to play the hand in this situation is if you 
could count on your opponent to call a bet at the end, after your 
flush card hits. Then your potential $50 win increases to $70, 
giving you 70-to-30 odds and justifying a call.2
It should be clear from this example that when you compute 
odds on a hand you intend to play to the end, you must think not 
in terms of the immediate pot odds but in terms of the total 
amount you might lose versus the total amount you might win. 
You have to ask, "What do I lose if I miss my hand, and what will 
I gain if I make it?" The answer to this question tells you your 
real or effective odds.
Let's look at an interesting, more complex application of 
effective odds. Suppose there is $250 in the pot, you have a
Effective Odds 51
back-door flush draw in hold' em, and an opponent bets $ 10. With 
a back-door flush you need two in a row of a suit. To make things 
simple, we'll assume the chances of catching two consecutive of 
a particular suit are 1/5 X 1/5. That's not quite right, but it's close 
enough.3 It means you'll hit a flush once in 25 tries on average, 
making you a 24-to-1 underdog. By calling your opponent's $10 
bet, you would appear to be getting 26-to-1. So you might say, 
"OK, I'm getting 26-to-1, and it's only 24-to-1 against me. 
Therefore, I should call to try to make my flush."
Your calculations are incorrect because they do not take into 
account your effective odds. One out of 25 times you will win the 
$260 in there, plus probably another $40 on the last two rounds of 
betting. Twenty times you will lose only $10 when your first card 
does not hit, and you need not call another bet. But the remaining 
four times you will lose a total of $30 each time when your first 
card hits, you call your opponent's $20 bet, and your second card 
does not hit. Thus, after 25 such hands, you figure to lose $320 
($200 + $120) while winning $300 for a net loss of $20. Your 
effective odds reveal a call on the flop to be a play with negative 
expectation and hence incorrect.
Situations When 
Effective Odds Need Not Apply
There are a few times when you do not have to consider 
future bets when assessing your pot odds. The first case occurs 
when either you or your opponent is all-in or almost all-in. 
Obviously, when your opponent has no more money to bet or you 
have no more money to call, the last card will be free. So all you 
need to do is observe your immediate pot odds and compare them 
to your chances of winding up with the best hand. In the example
2 While a call on the flop might be a bad play, a semi-bluff 
raise could be a good play. Sometimes folding is a better 
alternative to calling, but raising is the best alternative of all. (See 
Chapters Eleven and Thirteen.)
For the finicky, the exact equation is 10/47 x 9/46. Ten of 
the 47 unseen cards make a four-flush on fourth street, and then 
nine of the 46 remaining cards will produce the flush at the end.
52 Chapter Six
just given, if either you or your opponent were all-in when the 
opponent bet $10 on the flop and you called, it would be worth 
drawing to your back-door flush since it would now be a case of 
getting 26-to-1 on a 24-to-1 shot. However, you must remember 
that the chances of making the hand you are drawing to are not the 
same as your chances of winding up with the best hand. You 
might make your hand and still lose to a better hand.
There is a second case, similar to the first, when you might 
call in close situations even if your effective odds would indicate 
a fold. This comes up when you have good reason to think your 
opponent might check on the next round. If he does check, you are 
getting a free card just as though you or he were all-in. Once again 
all you need to consider are your immediate pot odds, since you 
expect to see two cards for the price of one. Such situations might 
come up when you suspect your opponent has a weak hand or 
when you think your opponent might fear to bet on the next round 
because he interprets your call to mean you're stronger than you 
really are, even when you don't catch the card you need.
Finally, it may sometimes be correct to call to see one card 
only when your effective odds indicate a fold. If that card does not 
make your hand, you should not call any further bets. These 
circumstances usually occur in games where there is a large 
increase in the bet from one round to the next. You might, for 
example, be playing in a $ 10-$50 hold 'em game and catch a four-
flush on the flop. Your opponent bets $ 10 into a $40 pot, and you 
expect he'll bet $50 on the next round. To call both bets would 
mean you were getting effective odds of 100-to-60, too low for 
you to contemplate going all the way with a flush draw. However, 
you are getting 5-to-1 on your opponent's first bet, which is 
greater than the odds against hitting on the next card (not to 
mention your potential profits on the last two betting rounds 
should you hit the flush). When deciding whether to call for one 
card only, all you need to consider are your immediate pot odds 
versus your chances of hitting on the next card only.
In most cases, however, when you have a hand that needs to 
improve, you must realize that future bets cut down your apparent
Effective Odds 53
pot odds substantially, frequently enough to make you throw the 
hand away. Therefore, before deciding to go all the way with a 
hand, you must calculate whether the effective odds you are 
getting by calling several rounds of betting justify a call now.
Calculating Effective Odds
Figuring effective odds may sound complicated, but it is a 
simple matter of addition. You add all the calls you will have to 
make, assuming you play to the end, to determine the total amount 
you will lose if you don't make your hand. Then compare this 
figure to the total amount you should win if you do make the 
hand. This total is the money in the pot at the moment plus all 
future bets you can expect to win, excluding your own future bets. 
Thus, if there is $100 in the pot at the moment and three more $20 
betting rounds, you are getting $ 160-to-$60 effective odds if both 
you and your opponent figure to call all bets. If you know you 
won't call on the end unless you make your hand, your effective 
odds become $ 160-to-$40. When you think your opponent won't 
call on the end if your card hits, your effective odds would be 
reduced to something like $140-to-$40. If, on early betting 
rounds, these odds are greater than your chances of making your 
hand, you are correct to see the hand through to the end. If they 
are not, you should fold.
Chapter Seven  
Implied Odds and 
Reverse Implied Odds
During the early and middle rounds of betting, having to call 
future bets usually reduces your apparent pot odds considerably, 
and you have to calculate your real or effective odds. However, 
there are times when the existence of future bets is the very reason 
you play a hand. Your immediate pot odds may not seem high 
enough to justify calling for one more card. But if that card may 
give you a monster hand that figures to get you a lot of action, you 
frequently don't need the initial odds from the pot. You'll get 
them later. These odds are what I mean by implied odds.
Implied Odds
Implied odds are based on the possibility of winning money 
in later betting rounds over and above what is in the pot already. 
More precisely, your implied odds are the ratio of your total 
expected win when your card hits to the present cost of calling a 
bet. A good example of playing a hand for the implied odds 
occurs in hold 'em when you have a small pair in the hole. It's 
about 8-to-l against flopping that card to hit three-of-a-kind, but 
the small pair is worth playing in most cases even getting 
something like 5-to-1. If there is $50 in the pot and it is $10 to you 
in a $10-$20 game, you are getting implied odds of about 150-to-
10, or 15-to-1, since you should average about $ 100 further profit 
when you do flop a set of trips. Of course, when you don't make 
trips, you would normally throw away your hand rather than call 
a bet on the flop.
55
56 Chapter Seven
In earlier discussions we have come across other situations 
where implied odds were operating. In Chapter Four on ante 
structure, we pointed out that in games with a small ante and a 
small initial bet in comparison to future bets, it pays to play looser 
than the small ante would dictate for the initial bet only. The 
reason is that the big bets in later rounds give you good implied 
odds.
For instance, the $l-$3 and $l-$4 seven-card stud games 
which you find in every card room in Las Vegas start off with a 
50-cent bet. It is not correct to play very tight for this initial bet, 
especially against the weaker players you tend to find in these 
games. When you can see fourth street for only 50 cents, you 
should, for example, call for one card with any pair, so long as 
your cards are live — that is, so long as few of the cards you need 
have appeared among your opponents' exposed cards. This is 
because your implied odds are enormous. Should you make two 
pair or, even better, three-of-a-kind, you figure to get a lot of 
action from lesser hands, especially when your initial pair is 
hidden.
Implied odds were operating in the example in Chapter Six 
on effective odds which advocated calling to see one card only if 
the immediate pot odds justify a call though your effective odds 
indicate a fold. The suggestion was that when your card hits, 
you'll probably make more money on future bets.
To take this point a step further, you might call even when 
the immediate pot odds do not quite justify a call if there is a large 
increase in the bet from one round to the next. Your possible 
future profits when your card hits — that is, your implied odds — 
will make up for the short odds you are getting at the moment. For 
example, if in a $10-$20 game an opponent bets $10 into a $20 
pot, your pot odds are 3-to-1, which would dictate throwing away, 
say, an open-ended straight. However, if your hand (or your 
opponent) is such that should the hand improve on the next round, 
you figure to beat your opponent for another $40 on future betting 
rounds, then your implied odds are $70-to-$10 or 7-to-l, which 
would make a call worthwhile with an open-ender. If you miss
Implied Odds and Reverse Implied Odds 57
and your opponent bets $20 on the next round, you would once 
again be getting 3-to-1 odds ($60-to-$20), but your implied odds 
would have diminished.
Implied Odds in 
Pot-Limit and No-Limit Games
In general, the larger the difference between future bets and 
the present bet you have to call, the greater your implied odds. 
Hence, implied odds become most significant in pot-limit games 
and in no-limit games, where a future bet can be as large as the 
amount of money a player has in front of him. In fact, in these 
games one is almost always considering not how much is in the 
pot right now, but rather how much can be won on a future round 
of betting.
A classic illustration of such a situation occurred in the final 
hand of the 1980 no-limit hold 'em championship at Binion's 
Horseshoe Casino in  Las Vegas. Doyle Brunson, a two-time 
world champion, had $232,500 in front of him, and his opponent, 
young Stu Ungar, a gin rummy and poker whiz from New York's 
lower East Side, had $497,500. (These astronomical sums resulted 
from  73 players buying into the championship tournament for 
$10,000 apiece.)
In the final hand Brunson held an ace,7, and Ungar, the 4 and 
5 of spades. Before the flop, $30,000 went into the pot, and then 
the cards came ace,2,7. Ungar checked, but looking at aces and 7s, 
Brunson bet $17,000, a bet intended to lure Ungar in.
"I wouldn't have called too much more than that for a gut 
shot," Ungar admitted. (A gut shot in poker parlance is a draw to 
an inside straight.) "But if Doyle has a hand, it's worth $17,000 
because if I do catch a 3, I'm going to bust him."
Ungar's call was strictly in terms of the implied odds he was 
getting. He had no thought for the $47,000 in the pot at the 
moment, which gave him less than 3-to-1 odds, but rather for 
Brunson's entire $232,500 stake. With $15,000 of his own money
58 Chapter Seven
also in the pot, Ungar's implied odds were approximately 141/2-
to-1; and with four 3s available among the 47 unseen cards, the 
odds against making the straight on the next card were 103/4-to-1. 
Hence his call.
Needless to say, a 3 fell on fourth street. Ungar bet $40,000. 
After some reflection, Brunson moved all-in with the remainder 
of his chips. Since Ungar had the nuts at that point (Brunson's 
only outs were an ace or a 7 on the last card to make a full house) 
he called gleefully and won the world championship.
At a poker seminar in Gardena, California, the following 
year, given by Brunson, myself, and draw poker expert Mike 
Caro, Brunson acknowledged he played incorrectly in betting 
$17,000 on the flop. He said that instead of giving Ungar the 
chance for a perfect card, he should have bet more than Ungar 
would have been able to call, in the event he did have an 
inside-straight draw — in other words, too much to warrant a call 
even in terms of implied odds.
When you estimate your implied odds, you must try to 
predict how much money you can win if you do make your hand. 
This prediction depends on three factors
1.The size of future bets.
2.How hidden your hand is.
3.The ability of your opponents.
Factors in Determining 
Implied Odds
Obviously, the larger the size of potential bets, the greater 
your implied odds and the more reason you have to call with a 
hand that might improve to the nuts. However, the other two 
factors are important too.
In adding the possibility of future bets to the present pot to 
get your implied odds, you should take into account whether the 
strength of your hand is hidden. When the cards that help are 
obvious, you cannot expect to get as much value out of your hand
Implied Odds and Reverse Implied Odds 59
if you make it, since opponents simply might not call when you 
bet.
When you have a close decision, you should call a bet against 
weaker opponents more readily than against tougher ones: You 
can usually assume you are getting higher implied odds from a 
weak player, who is more likely to call your bet or raise when you 
make your hand, than from a tough player, who may fold his hand 
and not pay you off.
Two words of caution. Implied odds obviously cannot apply 
when either you or your opponent is already all-in or nearly all-in. 
Secondly, implied odds have little meaning when there is a decent 
chance that you can make your hand but still wind up second best. 
If you are going to take a short price from the pot in hopes of 
winning future bets, you had better be awfully sure that your hand 
will hold up when you make it.
Reverse Implied Odds
Implied odds explain situations when your odds are better 
than they seem. There are other times when you must realize that 
your odds are not as good as they seem. These situations occur 
when you have a mediocre hand with little chance of improving, 
which you think is the best hand at the moment, yet your 
opponent keeps betting. You think he may be bluffing, and you 
can beat only a bluff— that is, a hand that is weaker than what 
your opponent is representing. However, since your opponent is 
controlling the betting, he will probably back off on later rounds 
if he doesn't have you beat. Thus, you are in the position of 
winning the minimum if you have the best hand but losing the 
maximum if you have the worst hand. The true pot odds in such 
situations are much worse than they seem, and so we call them 
reverse implied odds.
For instance, there is $50 in the pot, and your opponent bets 
$20. You think you have him beat, but you are not sure. You also 
have little chance of improving. You cannot say, "I'm getting 70-
to-20 odds here," because your opponent may come out betting
60 Chapter Seven
again next round if he has a better hand than yours — or if his 
hand improves to a better hand — but he is likely to give it up if 
he has a worse hand than yours. You are in a situation where, if 
you lose, you figure to lose not just the $20 you are calling right 
now but a total of $60. However, if you win, you'll probably win 
only the $70 in the pot right now because once your opponent sees 
you're committed to the pot, he won't bet further with the worst 
hand. All of a sudden, then, you're not getting 70-to-20 odds but 
closer to 70-to-60.
Actually, reverse implied odds of 70-to-60 represent the 
worst possible case of such situations, as they come up in practice. 
If, for instance, you are sure your opponent will not bet again 
without a good hand, then you should obviously fold if he does 
bet again. So you have risked only $20 and not $60 to win $70. 
Conversely, if there is some chance your opponent will bet once 
or twice more without the best hand, then when you continue 
calling, you are risking $40 to win $90 or $60 to win $110, 
depending on how many times he bets, You are risking $60 to win 
$70 only when you plan to call to the end if your opponent bets, 
even though you assume you have little chance of winning if he 
continues betting.
Summary
In sum, reverse implied odds describe situations in which:
1.You're not sure where you're at.
2.You have little chance of improving to beat the hand your
opponent might already have or might make.
3.A call commits you to calling future bets all the way to the
end.
4.Your opponent can back off at any time.
In such cases, you must not think you are getting odds according 
to what's in the pot and what you have to call right now. You are 
getting much worse odds — so much worse that it is often better
Implied Odds and Reverse Implied Odds 61
to throw your hand away immediately rather than get committed. 
Such a situation would occur in hold 'em if you held
and the flop came
A similar situation might occur in seven-card stud if you held two 
black aces and an opponent with three hearts on board came out 
betting on fifth street.
Whereas implied odds are based on the possibility of winning 
more money in later betting rounds, reverse implied odds are 
based on the possibility of losing more money in later betting 
rounds. Put another way, when you're getting implied odds, 
you're glad you're not all-in, for you expect to make money on 
future bets if your card hits. However, when you're getting 
reverse implied odds, you wish you were all-in so you could see 
the hand to the end without having to call future bets.
Chapter Eight  
The Value of Deception
One approach to poker is to raise when you have a very good 
hand and fold when you have a very bad hand. But what happens 
when you follow that approach? Let's say you have three aces 
rolled up on your first three cards in seven-card stud. That's the 
best possible hand you could have at that point. You put in a raise, 
and everybody folds. You have won a very small pot with a hand 
that potentially could have won a huge pot.
The Cost of Giving Your 
Hand Away
This extreme example points up a basic poker dilemma. You 
want to make the most of your hands by maximizing your gains 
and minimizing your losses, yet what are you costing yourself 
when you play in such a way that your opponents should know 
what you have? The answer to this question is contained in the 
Fundamental Theorem of Poker, which states that  every time 
opponents play a hand differently from the way they would have 
if  they could see all your cards, you gain; and every time they play 
a hand the same way they would have played it if they could see 
all your cards, you lose.
The Fundamental Theorem indicates that when you play in 
a way that lets your opponents know what you have, you may be 
costing yourself substantially. If opponents know exactly what 
you have, they will never make a mistake except on very close 
mathematical decisions. The more your play gives away what you 
have, the less likely it is that your opponents will make a mistake. 
Yet you want them to make mistakes. Creating mistakes is, in a 
sense, the whole objective of the game. Clearly you might not
63
64 Chapter Eight
want to raise immediately with three aces rolled up because you 
don't want your opponents to know what a strong hand you have. 
You want to win more money from them on later betting rounds. 
At the same time, never raising with a big hand could be a mistake 
too.
An interesting example of such a mistake came up toward the 
end of the 1977 World Series of Poker in a hand between two 
world-class players, Doyle Brunson from Longworth, Texas, and 
Bones Berland from Gardena, California. The game was no-limit 
hold 'em. Brunson had about $20,000 in front of him, and 
Berland, about $50,000. Before the flop Berland raised in early 
position, a hefty raise, and Brunson called him with two queens. 
The flop came J,5,2. Again Berland made a pretty good bet, and 
Brunson called him. On fourth street came another small card, and 
Bones made a gigantic bet, just about enough to put Doyle all-in. 
Doyle thought and thought and thought, and finally he pushed in 
his money and called.
Many people thought Brunson played incorrectly in calling 
with two queens. Berland was not about to bluff in this situation. 
These critics felt there was a great chance that Berland had two 
aces or two kings, and there were other hands he could have had 
that Doyle's two queens couldn't beat. Given the way he played 
it, the only hand Bones might possibly have that Brunson could 
beat was an ace, jack — the top pair on board with an ace kicker.
When Bones turned over his cards in the showdown, he had 
precisely ace, jack. Brunson won the hand with two queens and 
went on to win the world championship of poker that year. I asked 
Doyle afterward about his risky call. "Well," he said, "Bones 
couldn't have two aces or two kings because he never raised in 
early position with these hands before the flop. He would just call, 
hoping to reraise, you know, on a slowplay."
Here was a case, then, where a top player was given 
information because another top player played properly but with 
too much consistency. In no-limit hold 'em it is generally correct 
to slowplay in early position with two aces or two kings. 
However, when Berland always played those pairs the same way,
The Value of Deception 65
as he supposedly did, the information he gave away was much 
more costly than the money he figured to gain by playing the aces 
and kings properly every time.
To illustrate further the cost of giving away your hand, 
suppose you are playing head-up razz with no ante, no forced bet, 
and all the time in the world. You have decided, therefore, to play 
super-super-tight, folding everything except A,2,3 on your first 
three cards. With no ante it would seem you're a cinch to end up 
a winner, but the fact is a good player will slaughter you. He'll 
soon know you are playing only A,2,3, and he'll play his cards 
accordingly. He'll start off with slightly worse hands than yours, 
like three-card 5s and three-card 6s, but he'll wind up beating you 
on later plays since he'll know exactly what you have. He'll know 
when you pair up and when you don't, and he'll never make a 
mistake. On the other hand, though you start out with the better 
hand, you will make mistakes because you won't know what your 
opponent has. Thus, while in general it is correct to play very tight 
when there is no ante and no forced bet, by playing only A,2,3 in 
razz, you are giving away so much information that you don't 
stand a chance against a good opponent.
Deception and the Ability of 
Your Opponents
A question you must always address, then, is when to play a 
hand straightforwardly and when to use deception. The most 
important criterion for making this decision is the ability of your 
opponents. The tougher they are, the more you must consider 
playing a hand other than optimally to throw them off. The 
weaker they are, the more you can get away with optimum play. 
Thus, if you have a good hand on an early round, you would not 
put in that last raise against tough players, but with a weaker hand 
you might consider putting in an extra bet to make your opponents 
think your hand is stronger than it is. For example, with a three-
flush on third street in seven-card stud you might throw in a
66 Chapter Eight
reraise to create the wrong impression. Now if you happen to pair 
on board, you have the extra equity that your opponents may fold 
incorrectly, afraid you have three-of-a-kind or two pair.
On the other hand, if you are playing against dunces or just 
mediocre players, you don't gain enough in deception to justify 
the cost. Against such players you should put in an extra raise 
when you think you have the best hand, but throwing in an extra 
bet with a weaker hand, against someone who won't fold anyway, 
simply costs you extra money. In using deception, then, you must 
weigh the ability of your opponents against the extra cost.
Deception and the 
Size of the Pot
Another criterion for deciding how to play a hand is the size 
of the pot. As the pot grows larger and larger, it becomes less and 
less important to disguise your hand because good players are not 
likely to fold any more than bad players are. Nor will good 
players try to bluff as much when you show weakness, because 
they too recognize that the pot is so big there is almost no chance 
you will fold. So when the pot has become large, you usually no 
longer have to think about using deception.
Deception and Bet Size
There is a related concept. If early bets are much smaller than 
later bets, you usually shouldn't throw in a small raise with a big 
hand. You may put people on guard so that even if they don't fold 
immediately, they will when the bets increase in later rounds. 
You're likely to get more action on your big hands by slowplaying 
them. Conversely, with a large increase in bets from one round to 
another, you may decide to put in extra action with a weaker hand 
on an early, cheap betting round to create the wrong impression 
later when the bets are expensive. Thus, you should consider not 
only the amount in the pot now but also how much the bets are
The Value of Deception 67
now compared to what they may be later. You might check a big 
hand early to win big bets later, and on the other hand, you might 
bet with a weaker hand early in hopes that your opponents will 
check later to give you a free card.
Obviously, you can better afford to disguise your hand in 
early rounds in pot-limit and no-limit games than in limit games, 
since both the size of the pot and the size of the bets may increase 
enormously from one round of betting to the next. With a big hand 
and a lot of money in front of you, you can check and give your 
opponents many more free cards. You are not so concerned about 
protecting the money in the pot as you are about getting paid off 
when you bet a much larger amount later. Furthermore, it costs 
too much to protect small pots, especially when you have only a 
fair hand. To win them, you need to make a considerably bigger 
bet than you would in limit games, and so in no-limit you would 
tend to give more free cards even when you are not altogether 
happy about it. (See Chapter Ten, "The Free Card.")
Deception and the 
Number of Opponents in the Pot
With weak players, with a large pot, and with large early 
bets, you need not be so concerned about disguising your hand. A 
corollary is that the more players in the pot, the less you gain by 
disguising your hand. You cost yourself too much when you do. 
You won't be able to make everybody fold when you bet with a 
weak hand, and you cost yourself too many bets when you miss 
a raise with a strong hand. What's more, when you let many 
opponents in cheaply, you increase the chances of being 
outdrawn. Heads-up situations require disguising your hand more 
than do multi-way pots.
Let's look at two early-round betting situations — one in 
which you don't care that you've given your hand away and the 
other in which you should use deception. In both situations you
68 Chapter Eight
have a pair of aces in the hole before the flop in hold 'em. That is, 
you have the nuts, the best possible hand at that point.
The first game is no-limit. You've made a small raise, four or 
five people have called, and now someone puts in a substantial 
reraise. You must reraise again even if your play gives away your 
hand completely. It is worth dropping all disguise because as the 
pot gets larger and larger, what's in the pot right now counts more 
than potential bets on later rounds. With two aces you should put 
in all the bets you can.
On the other hand, with two aces against a good player in a 
limit hold 'em game, you should often not put in all bets. A 
reraise is fine because you could have a variety of hands. 
However, if your single opponent reraises again, you should 
probably just call. If you raise one more time, your opponent 
figures you for two aces. All you have gained is one small extra 
bet right there, but you may have cost yourself two or three bets 
later on. In this case, you have lost too much by giving your hand 
away. You stand to gain more by using deception.
Summary
The general rule is: The better the players and the smaller the 
pot, the more you disguise your hand when there are more cards 
to come. The worse the players and the larger the pot, the more 
you play your hand normally, without regard to giving anything 
away. Sometimes, though, playing your hand normally may be the 
best deception of all against very tough players who expect you to 
be deceptive. The following hand from seven-card stud will 
illustrate this point:
Opponent
If a tough opponent acts before you and raises, reraise just as 
you would against a sucker. A tough opponent who has two kings 
knows you might be reraising with a three-flush or any number of 
second-best hands. So you still have your deception as well as an 
extra bet.
It is extremely important to disguise your hand against 
players who put great emphasis on reading hands, though such 
players may not necessarily be good, and when deceptive play has 
gotten the super readers confused, they've got no chance. This 
type tends to put you on a hand early, and like a captain going 
down with the ship, he sticks to his opinion until the end.
There are five criteria for using deception to avoid giving 
your hand away.
1.You are up against good players or super readers.
2.The pot is small in comparison to future bets.
3.The present round of betting is small in comparison to future
bets.
4.You have only one or two opponents against you.
5.You are slowplaying a monster hand.
The first two conditions are most significant. It is not 
necessary to meet all five conditions before deception is 
employed. Three of the five are usually sufficient so long as one 
or both of the first two are included.
Do not use deception against bad players, against many
players, when the pot is large, or when the early bets are large. It
is especially important to play a good hand strongly if the pot is
large. The only exception would be when you have an unbeatable
You

70 Chapter Eight
hand and figure you will gain more by waiting a round before 
making your move.
The basis of your decision to play normally or deceptively is 
simple. You should play each session and each hand of each 
session in the way that will win the most money and lose the least 
(except when you intentionally play a hand badly to create an 
impression  for  future  hands).  Always  remember  from  the 
Fundamental Theorem of Poker that the more your opponents 
know about your hand, the less likely they are to make mistakes. 
However, there are situations when deception can be costly and 
straightforward play is best. We shall look at such situations in the 
next chapter.
Chapter Nine  
Win the Big Pots 
Right Away
As we showed in the last chapter, it is often important to 
disguise your big hands so that your opponents don't know what 
you have because you want to get as much value for them as you 
can. However, there is one special application of the Fundamental 
Theorem of Poker, which we hinted at: As a pot gets larger and 
larger, you nearly always want to win it instantly. Naturally you 
would like your opponent to play incorrectly and throw away the 
best hand. But even when your hand is the best hand, you 
generally prefer your opponent to fold rather than call when the 
pot is large. The reason is that when you bet in a limit game and 
the pot is large, your opponent's hand, though second best, is 
rarely so much of an underdog that he is not getting good enough 
odds to chase you. Hence, his calling you with good odds is a 
profitable play for him in the long run. Since he is correct to take 
the odds, you do not gain when he calls. You gain only when he 
folds and turns down those odds. When he calls, you lose even if 
you happen to win that particular pot; for over the long run his 
call has positive expectation. It will end up costing you money.
Betting When Your Opponent 
is Correct to Call
At the same time, it would be incorrect not to bet at all with 
the best hand, even though you were 100 percent certain your 
opponent would make the correct play and call. By not betting, 
you are giving your opponent a free chance to make the best hand. 
Put another way, you are giving him infinite odds. Let's say the
71
72 Chapter Nine
odds are 5-to-1 against your opponent making a hand that beats 
yours. By betting $20 into a $ 150 pot, you are offering that player 
81/2-to-l odds ($170-to-$20), and so he is correct to call the $20. 
But by betting nothing, you are offering him infinite odds, in that 
he has to call zero dollars for the chance to win $150. Therefore, 
when the pot is large — even though you are offering your 
opponent favorable odds — it is always correct to bet with the 
best hand. The opponent's odds are not so favorable as they would 
be if you didn't bet at all. Furthermore, there is always the outside 
chance he might give up and fold. (See the next chapter for an 
extensive discussion on the free card.)
In no-limit and pot-limit games it is easier to win the big pots 
right away because you have the luxury of being able to bet 
almost any amount. So you can choose what odds to give your 
opponent. For example, with a $150 pot in a pot-limit game and 
your opponent a 5-to-1 underdog, betting the maximum $150 
allows you to offer your opponent 2-to-l odds ($300 to $150) on 
a 5-to-1 shot. If your opponent calls, he is taking the worst of it, 
and you are not unhappy with the call. Whenever possible, then, 
with the best hand, bet an amount large enough so that by calling, 
your opponent is not making the correct play. Furthermore, in 
no-limit and pot-limit games, you must be careful, as we saw in 
Chapter Seven, to bet a sufficiently large amount so that your 
opponent is not getting sufficiently good implied odds to make a 
call correct.
By definition, in limit games you are not free to bet whatever 
you want, and when the pot gets large, it's hard to make a player 
fold. However, unless you have the pure nuts, you should give 
your opponent every opportunity to fold and make it as expensive 
as you can for him to call, even when by calling he is still getting 
favorable odds.
Win the Big Pots Right Away 73
Betting (or Raising) to 
Drive Opponents Out
One step toward winning a big pot is driving out as many 
opponents as possible. Let's say you are playing seven-card stud, 
and there has been a lot of raising on the first three cards, which 
has created a big pot. You have three-of-a-kind, a powerful hand, 
and now on fourth street the man to your right bets. Should you 
call or raise? You should definitely raise even though you are 
driving out all the weaker hands behind you. Indeed that is 
precisely the purpose of your raise. The pot has become 
sufficiently large for you to try to win it right now, forsaking any 
future bets you might win. If everybody folds after you raise, you 
are delighted. If your raise succeeds only in cutting down the 
number of opponents, that's still pretty good.
Most people don't think in terms of this special case of the 
Fundamental Theorem of Poker, but it is vital. Wanting to win the 
present pot instantly — even with the best hand — depends on 
your chances of winning if the hand continues and upon the pot 
odds you are giving your opponents. You must ask yourself 
whether an opponent would be correct to take those odds knowing 
what you had. If so, you would rather have that opponent fold. If 
not — that is, if the odds against your opponent's making a 
winning hand are greater than the pot odds he's getting — then 
you would rather have him call. In this case, instead of winning 
the pot right away, you're willing to take the tiny risk that your 
opponent will outdraw you and try to win at least one more bet. If, 
in the seven-stud example of the preceding paragraph you had 
four-of-a-kind instead of three-of-a-kind, you would not want to 
put in a raise to drive people out. Your hand is so good you'd 
want to collect a few more bets with it.
It's rare to catch a monster hand like four-of-a-kind in the 
first four or five cards. With just about anything less than that, you 
should try to win large pots right away instead of letting players 
in cheaply or free. Nor do the pots you go after have to be
74 Chapter Nine
Win the Big Pots Right Away 75
gigantic, just fairly large relative to the betting structure of the 
game you're playing. Your opponent or opponents may fold after 
you bet or raise, but while you might have won another bet or two, 
you still have the reward of having locked up a good-sized pot.
Betting (or Raising) With the 
Second-Best Hand
There is a curious corollary to the principle of trying to win 
the big pots right away. Obviously you want to bet or raise to 
drive out as many players as possible when you have the best 
hand. But if the pot is very large, it is frequently desirable to do 
the same even when you suspect you have the second-best hand, 
especially when you believe you're not that far behind.
A good example of this concept comes up in razz:
You
You have four cards to an 8, and you suspect the player to 
your right, Player C, has four to a 6. If there are a few raises on 
third street, creating a good-sized pot, it is important that you raise 
the 6,4 when he comes out betting, even though his hand is 
probably better than yours and he will probably reraise. Why 
should you be willing to add two bets to the pot when you suspect 
you don't have the best hand? The answer is that you want to 
force out the other two hands. With a large pot they might call a 
single bet, but in the face of a bet, a raise, (and a probable reraise), 
they should now fold. You have succeeded in reducing the 
opposition to one, and you now have about a 45 percent chance of 
winning the pot. Your underdog status is more than compensated 
by all that extra dead money in there. On the other hand, with the 
other players involved, you would have only about a 30 percent 
chance of winning the pot.
Player В
Player С
Player A
76 Chapter Nine
Let's look at a similar situation in seven-card stud. You have 
two queens and the raising on third street has produced a large 
pot. The man to your immediate right has
Your hand may or may not be the best hand. You don't think it is, 
but you are quite sure it is second-best and not much of an 
underdog. If the man to your right with the
comes out
betting on fourth street, you should raise to drive the other players 
out. In the event your two queens is the best hand because the
 is a four-flush or two 9s, you don't have to worry about 
any of the other players outdrawing you. On the other hand, if 
the
 is in fact two kings, you have a better chance of winning 
the pot against him alone than you would if you let in other 
players who could outdraw you even if you made queens up or 
three queens.
The same principle comes up in hold 'em. The man to your 
right bets, putting you in a position to raise immediately to make 
other people fold. When the pot is large, you should do it with a 
good hand even if you suspect it might not be the best.
Delaying One Round to 
Drive Opponents Out
In structured games the size of the bet doubles on the third 
round of betting — for example, from $5 to $ 10 in a $5-$ 10 game 
and from $10 to $20 in a $10-$20 game. In these games you may 
want to wait until the bet doubles in size before putting in a raise 
— not as a slowplay but as a better way of driving people out. If 
in $10-$20, for example, you raise a $10 bet to $20 on the second
Win the Big Pots Right Away 77
round, some players behind you may be willing to call; but if you 
wait until the next round to raise a $20 bet to $40, these players 
will not be so willing to pay the price. The greater likelihood of 
driving opponents out with a big raise on the third round of 
betting offsets the cheap $10 card you allowed them on the 
previous round.
Summary
The basic concept set forth in this chapter is a simple one. 
When the pot is big, you want to win it right away. To try to win 
it right away, you should bet and raise as much as possible, 
hoping to drive everybody out, but at least reducing the 
opposition. You should bet and raise with the best hand, and you 
should frequently do the same even with a hand you think maybe 
second best. The fewer opponents you have in a pot, the greater 
your chances of winning it, even if those chances are less than 50 
percent; and when the pot gets large, winning it should be your 
foremost concern.
Chapter Ten  
The Free Card
A free card is exactly that. It is a card that does not cost a bet 
to receive. While players might get a free card (or cards) in draw 
poker if a hand is checked around before the draw, concepts about 
the free card apply primarily to stud and hold 'em games where 
there are several rounds of betting.
In general, when you have the best hand, you do not want to 
give opponents a free card since you are giving them a chance to 
outdraw you and win the pot. By the same token, when you do not 
have the best hand, you want to try to get a free card to get a free 
shot at winning the pot.
Giving a Free Card
Giving a free card means checking a hand you could have bet 
when there are more cards to come. Of course, when you check 
with the intention of raising, you are giving a free card only when 
your opponent is so uncooperative as not to bet into you.
When you know or are pretty sure you have the best hand, 
you have to decide whether or not to give your opponent a free 
card. We saw in the last chapter that it is almost never correct to 
give a free card when the pot is large. It turns out that it is rarely 
correct to give a free card with medium-sized pots, even when you 
know your opponent will fold if you bet. You simply have to be 
satisfied with what there is in the pot already. One reason you 
should bet is that generally you want your opponent to fold.
If there is, let's say, $50 in the pot and you bet $10, your 
opponent is getting 6-to-1 odds. As a 5-to-1 underdog, he should 
call. As we have seen in earlier chapters, any opponent who
79
80 Chapter Ten
doesn't take the odds when he has the best of it is losing money. 
Therefore, you have gained when that person folds.
However, the principle of not giving a free card goes even 
further. If your opponent is a 9-to-1 underdog, getting 6-to-1 odds, 
you should still bet. In this case, you hope that opponent calls, but 
you don't mind when he folds. His folding is better than your 
giving him a free 10 percent chance to make his hand and beat 
you. As we saw in the last chapter, giving a free card is equivalent 
to giving a person infinite odds on that betting round. That person 
needs to make a zero investment for a chance to win whatever is 
in the pot.
Suppose, going into the last card in seven-card stud, you 
think a player has a gut-shot draw to a straight, and you have 
three-of-a-kind. Your opponent is at least a 10-to-l underdog to 
make the straight, and even if he hits, you may make a full house. 
So you're a big favorite to win the hand. Nevertheless, it is still 
better that you bet and force your opponent to fold than that you 
check and he check behind you. By checking you are giving your 
opponent a free shot at beating you, a chance he would not have 
if you had bet.
When you are not so big a favorite, it is even more important 
to bet rather than give a free card. Let's say you have
in hold 'em, and the flop comes up three spades. With a modest 
pot you should come out betting even though you expect 
everybody will fold because you can't let somebody with, say, a 
lone
get a free shot at a higher flush. You might not want 
the person to fold when you bet, but making him fold is better 
than giving him a free chance to outdraw you. (The only time 
you might check your flush is if the pot is so small you expect to 
gain
The Free Card 81
more through deception. Thus, if no spades fall after the flop, your 
profits on later bets are likely to be considerably larger than what 
you would gain by betting on the flop. However, if another spade 
does come, you have to be prepared to fold.)
When you have a chance to bet and you have a decent hand, 
especially a hand you think is the best one, it is almost always 
correct to bet. The only conditions that might make it incorrect to 
bet are the following:
1.The pot is small in comparison to what it might be in the
future and you figure to gain more in future bets through
deception than by giving your hand away now; this situation
occurs most often in pot-limit and no-limit games.
2.You think you can get in a check-raise.
3.Your hand is so strong it's worth giving a free card even with
a medium-sized pot.
Giving or Not Giving a 
Free Card in Practice
We'll look at two hold 'em hands to see the difference 
between a situation where you should bet and another where you 
might consider checking. In both cases there is a medium-sized 
pot:
Player В
Player A
82 Chapter Ten
Board
The Free Card 83
Now we'll change your pair of jacks to a pair of aces:
You
Player A
P
With two jacks you should bet in an attempt to win the pot right there, even if 
you think only a better hand will call. If you give your opponents a free card (with 
what would have been the best hand) and an ace, king, or queen falls on fourth street, 
you are clearly in trouble. Thus, you don't want to give your opponents a free chance 
to draw one of those cards to make a higher pair than yours. Even if an ace, king, or 
queen doesn't make an opponent a higher pair, your checking on the flop gives 
anyone the opportunity to bluff you successfully if one of those cards falls.
B
Y
With aces you can give serious consideration to checking on 
the flop. Having two aces instead of two jacks has not 
significantly affected your chances of having the best hand since 
we'll assume that in both cases there has been no reason to think 
you are up against two kings or two queens in the hole. With two 
aces, however, you are not worried about as many fourth street 
cards as you would be with two jacks, and so you might as well 
check just in case someone has made three 10s. Assuming no one 
has a 10 in the hole, an additional benefit of your checking your 
pair of aces is that you have disguised your hand. Not only do you
84 Chapter Ten
not fear a king, queen, or ace falling on fourth street (as you 
would with a pair of jacks), you would welcome it, since any of 
those cards, as well as a jack, might give an opponent a playable 
second-best hand.
Of course, you should nearly always bet if you think a worse 
hand will call. You should also bet if the pot is large, since a large 
pot is worth the risk of running into three 10s in order to shut out 
the possibility that a miracle card will fall for an opponent on the 
next round. With a large pot it is also more likely that an opponent 
will call your bet with a bad hand like
or
Now let's suppose you are in another hold 'em hand. There 
is a medium-sized pot, and the flop comes:
How should you play with two jacks? How should you play with 
two kings?
The Free Card 85
With two jacks you would once again be more inclined to bet 
since there are more free cards that will beat you. But with two 
kings in the hole, it might be better to check in case someone has 
made a pair of aces. If you do have the best hand, you have less to 
lose by giving a free card since fewer cards will beat you than 
when you have two jacks.
The basic concept to be emphasized is that you do not want 
to give an opponent with a worse hand a free card that might 
make his hand better than yours. Therefore, if you expect to be 
called, always bet what you think is the best hand unless you 
figure it is better to try for a check-raise. Except when you have 
reason to slowplay, either because the pot is small or because you 
have a monster hand, always bet the best hand even if you don't 
expect to be called. You gain most when your opponent folds if 
there were sufficient pot odds for a call. However, even when 
your opponent isn't getting good enough pot odds to call and 
figures to fold, you should bet. You would prefer a call when that 
opponent is making a mistake by calling, but making him fold is 
still better than giving him a free shot to outdraw you.
Getting a Free Card
If not giving a free card is that important, it should be clear 
how valuable it is to get a free card when you don't have the best 
hand. That free card might turn a hand you would have folded into 
a winner or save you a bet on a hand with which you intended to 
call anyway. Of course, getting a free card against reasonably 
good players is not easy. One way is to put in a small raise on an 
early round in the hope that everyone still in the pot will check 
around to you on the next round. Then you can also check. To 
make this play you must be sure you will act after your opponent 
(or opponents) on the next round, so the play is used most 
commonly in a game like hold 'em where the order of betting is 
fixed by the position of the dealer.
Other ways of getting a free card fall under the heading of 
tricks and ploys. For example, you can bet out of turn to make
86 Chapter Ten
your opponent check, which is not quite ethical but usually legal. 
After being reminded it's not your turn to act, you retrieve your 
bet, and when your opponent checks, you also check. You can 
take chips from your stack as though you intend to raise, and then 
when your opponent decides not to bet after all, you check. 
Sometimes just getting your chips ready to call, as though you're 
enthusiastic about calling, will prevent your opponent from 
betting. However, against top players such plays usually work 
only to create a bad impression, and they rarely succeed more than 
once or twice.
Position and the Free Card
When a hand is reduced to two opponents, the player who 
acts first cannot give himself a free card, but the player who acts 
second can. If you are second to act and your opponent has 
checked to you, you should bet when you are pretty sure you have 
the best hand; but if you suspect you have the worst hand, you can 
check and give yourself a free card.
When you check in first position, you are not giving yourself 
a free card; you are offering your opponent a free card. That 
player can decide whether to take it or to bet. Consequently, in 
first position you have to bet some hands you wouldn't bet in last 
position because you do not want to give your opponent the option 
of checking for a free card with the worst hand. With a marginal 
hand you should bet in first position, especially if you don't fear 
a raise, because if your opponent has a worse hand than yours, he 
will check behind you when you check, making you wish you had 
bet. On the other hand, if your opponent's hand is indeed better 
than yours, he will bet when you check. So you couldn't give 
yourself a free card anyway.
The Free Card 87
Giving or Not Giving a 
Free Card With a Marginal Hand
When you are certain you have the best hand, deciding 
whether to bet with more cards to come is relatively easy. 
However, you are frequently in a situation where you suspect you 
have the best hand, but you know you will be called only if you 
are beaten. Still, you must consider betting so that you do not give 
your opponent a free shot to outdraw you in the event you do have 
the best hand. The factors to consider when deciding to bet are:
1.Your chances of having the best hand.
2.The chances the next card will give your opponent the best
hand when he would have folded had you bet.
3.The size of the pot.
4.The chances you will outdraw a better hand that might call
you.
The larger the pot and the greater the chances your opponent will 
outdraw you on the next card, the more reason you have to bet.
Point number 4 needs some explaining. Suppose you are 
afraid you do not have as good a hand as your opponent. Before 
betting, you should take into account what your chances are of 
outdrawing the hand you fear your opponent might have. The 
higher those chances, the more reason you have to bet. The lower 
they are, the more reason you have to check. To take an obvious 
example first, if you have two pair and a four-flush in seven-card 
stud and you are worried that your opponent has made a straight, 
you should most certainly bet rather than give him a free card in 
the event he does not yet have the straight. Your combined 
chances of making either a full house or a flush to beat a straight 
are very good. On the other hand, if you have two pair with no 
four-flush and fear your opponent has made a straight, you would 
be inclined to check since your chances of making a full house are 
slim.
88 Chapter Ten
Here is a more subtle example of the same principle from 
hold 'em. The flop comes:
In one instance you are holding
and in the other you are holding
The Free Card 89
The fewer ways you have of improving, the more convinced 
you have to be that you already have the best hand in order to bet. 
Thus, while you might check two 8s when the flop comes 
 , you would most definitely bet two queens even 
though the latter hand also has only two ways of improving 
(the remaining two queens). With two queens you are pretty sure 
you already have the best hand, yet you are not strong enough to 
risk giving a free card.
Summary
When you're trying to decide whether or not to bet your hand 
and worry about making a mistake, you should keep in mind one 
very important principle — a mistake that costs you the pot is a 
catastrophe, especially if the pot has become relatively large, 
while a mistake that costs you one bet is not. When in doubt, 
make sure you don't make a mistake that costs you the pot. 
Checking and giving an opponent with a worse hand a free card 
may cost you the pot when he outdraws you. However, betting 
and getting called by a better hand costs you at most just that one 
bet. Thus, the only time to give free cards with the probable best 
hand is when your hand is so strong it is in little danger of being 
outdrawn and your deception sets up the likelihood of larger 
profits in future bets in comparison to what is currently in the pot.
Which hand would you be more inclined to bet? It turns out you 
are in much better shape with the
(which gives you two 7s)
than you are with two 8s because there are five unseen cards that 
will improve the
three aces and two 7s — while there are
only two cards that will improve the pair of 8s — namely, the 
remaining two 8s. (You disregard pairing any card on board since 
the pair improves your opponent's hand as much as or perhaps 
even more than it does your own.) Since you have more ways of 
improving to beat someone with, say, two jacks, you would be 
more inclined to bet with an A,7.
Chapter Eleven  
The Semi-Bluff
Remember what was said toward the end of the last chapter 
about betting when you are afraid you do not have the best hand. 
The more ways you have of improving to become the best hand, 
the more reason you have to bet. The semi-bluff is an extension 
of this concept. From another point of view, it is an extension of 
theories of bluffing, which are discussed in Chapters Eighteen and 
Nineteen. I define the semi-bluff this way: A semi-bluff is a bet 
with a hand which, if called, does not figure to be the best hand at 
the moment but has a reasonable chance of outdrawing those 
hands that initially called it.
Obviously, then, a semi-bluff cannot occur unless there are 
more cards to come. When you bet as a semi-bluff, you are 
rooting to win right there just as you are when you make a pure 
bluff. However, in contrast to a pure bluff, you still retain a 
chance of outdrawing your opponent if you are called. Even when 
you bet with a legitimate hand, you are generally rooting to win 
instantly, but when you semi-bluff, you especially want your 
opponents to fold because one of them may be folding the best 
hand.
The semi-bluff is one of the least understood tools of poker, 
yet it is a very valuable and potent weapon. All professional 
players use it, and it may be used in any game. It may be a bet, a 
raise, or even a check-raise. Essentially you are representing a 
bigger hand than you actually have; however, in contrast to a pure 
bluff, your hand must have some chances of improving to the best 
hand.

92 Chapter Eleven
The Semi-Bluff 93
Types of Semi-Bluffs
Betting on the come is the most commonly used form of the 
semi-bluff. When you raise with a four-flush in draw poker, you 
are using a semi-bluff. You are hoping your opponents fold right 
there, but if they don't, you may make your flush and beat them 
anyway. Raising with
in draw lowball is a semi-bluff; you'd like your opponents to fold 
but don't mind a call that much since you have a good chance of 
drawing the best low hand. In hold 'em, betting after the flop with 
the third pair and an ace kicker or the third pair and an inside 
straight draw would be a semi-bluff: In this case, you want very 
much to win instantly, but if you are called you still have a chance 
of outdrawing your opponent.
Let's say in seven-card stud a player representing kings bets 
on fifth street, and you hold:
You make a semi-bluff raise, representing a straight. You'd like 
to win right there, but you have a good chance of making the 
straight if you are called. Furthermore, you'll almost certainly get 
a free card on the next round when the king checks to you. Also 
if you don't make the straight, you may possibly win with two 
pair or three 4s.
Semi-bluffs can be much more varied and often more 
complex than simply betting on the come. They can range from 
almost pure bluffs, when your hand has little chance of catching 
up if your bet is called, to a bet with a hand that may possibly be 
the best hand. In the first case, you have to think you have almost 
as good a chance of getting away with the bluff as you would with 
a pure bluff, taking into account the pot odds you're getting. In the 
second case, when you may in fact have the best hand, it is 
essential to bet to keep from giving a worse hand a free card. 
Betting is particularly important when you're in first position, in 
which case you should apply the following rule: If your hand is 
worth a call or almost worth a call when someone else bets, it is 
better to bet yourself, especially when you have little fear of a 
raise and when there is some chance you will win right there by 
making your opponent fold.
We'll look at two examples of semi-bluffs from seven-card 
stud. In the first, you are making a semi-bluff bet because your 
hand is worth a call if you checked and your opponent bet. Let's 
say you have:
Right off the bat a queen raises you. You know the raiser is not a 
very imaginative player, but he may be raising with a three-flush 
or something like a pair of 7s in the hole. You call.
On the next card, you catch an ace, giving you a pair of 8s 
and an ace, king kicker. Your opponent catches a small card. You 
are high on board, and now it is very important to bet because 
with a pair and two overcards your hand is certainly worth a call 
if you check and your opponent bets. Furthermore, you have little 
reason to think your opponent will raise because he now fears that 
you have made a pair of aces or even aces up. In fact, your
94 Chapter Eleven
opponent may fear what you are representing so much that he 
might fold the best hand.
The added equity of possibly winning right there when your 
opponent folds is the primary reason to semi-bluff. If you had 
checked your pair of 8s with an ace, king and called your 
opponent's bet, you would have a reasonable chance of making 
kings up, aces up, or three 8s to beat his queens or queens up. By 
betting out instead of checking and calling, you add to these 
chances the possibility of winning right away. This possibility 
gives a semi-bluff greater mathematical expectation than checking 
and calling since it adds another way to win besides winding up 
with the best hand in the showdown.
If you know there is no chance that your opponent will fold 
a pair of queens, the semi-bluff becomes more debatable, for by 
definition a semi-bluff is a bet where there is some chance your 
opponent will fold a hand he should have played. However, since 
you would call your opponent's bet anyway, betting yourself still 
has certain advantages. Your bet suggests more strength than you 
actually have. Suppose you catch something like two running 6s. 
When you bet with nothing but 8s and 6s, your opponent will 
probably fold a hand that he shouldn't have if he knew what you 
had. Even when a semi-bluff has no chance of making an 
opponent fold immediately, it may lead him to fold later when 
your board appears to improve to a better hand than you actually 
have. This situation comes up only in stud games, both high and 
low, where your opponent can see you "improve." It does not 
occur as much in hold 'em, where everyone shares a common 
board, nor, of course, in draw.
In the second semi-bluff example from seven-card stud, you 
are more of an underdog if your opponent has the hand he is 
representing. Nevertheless, a semi-bluff is indisputably the correct 
play:
Opponent
Your opponent raised on the first round, and you called with 
a three-flush. Now when you pair fours in sight, you must bet 
even though you have only a small pair with no overcard and your 
chances of making a spade flush are about 9-to-1 against. Your 
opponent will fold without a pair, which is to your advantage, and 
he may fold a higher pair, thinking you've made three 4s, which 
would be great. On the other hand, if he calls your bet, you still 
have several ways of beating him.
Advantages of the Semi-Bluff
First, the semi-bluff tends to make your opponent play 
incorrectly according to the Fundamental Theorem of Poker. 
When you semi-bluff, you presumably do not have the best hand. 
If your opponent could see your cards, his correct play would be 
to raise. However, since you are representing something with your 
semi-bluff, opponents will nearly always only call. Sometimes 
they will make the worst play of all by folding the best hand.
Second, when the hand with which you are semi-bluffing is 
in fact the best hand at the moment, by betting you are not making
The Semi-Bluff 95
You
96 Chapter Eleven
the mistake of giving worse hands free cards. As we saw in the 
previous chapter, it is critical to bet the best hand with more cards 
to come in order to avoid giving people a free card. Not only will 
a worse hand usually fold, which is fine, especially if the 
opponent is getting proper odds to call, but a better hand might 
fold. If the better hand calls, which is more likely, you still have 
the chance of improving to the best hand. If, instead of betting, 
you check and a better hand bets, your hand probably justifies a 
call. So you have gained nothing by checking. You do not get 
yourself a free card. Hence, you are more likely to semi-bluff in 
first position than in last, where you have the option of giving 
yourself a free card.
A third advantage of the semi-bluff is that, used correctly, it 
adds an enormous amount of deceptiveness to your game. For 
example, suppose in seven-card stud you started with:
The Semi-Bluff 97
giving you
showing. This is a good spot for a semi-bluff
raise even if you are almost certain your opponent will call you. 
Why? Well, notice what happens when you catch certain cards on 
fifth street. If you catch a card such as the
or for that 
matter  any card that looks as if it's given you a straight or a 
flush, your opponent will very possibly fold, if not a better hand, 
certainly a hand that was justified in calling against a measly 
pair of 7s. Suppose you catch a jack or a queen, making a pair 
on board. Now your opponent almost has to fold because of the 
strength you showed by your earlier raise. However, if he in fact 
has two kings,  he is making a mistake folding against two 
smaller pair. Finally, notice what happens if you catch the one 
card that will make you root for a call, namely a 7, which gives 
you three-of-a-kind. Because of your previous bet, that 7 will 
look completely  harmless, as though it didn't help your hand 
one bit. Now when you bet, your opponent will keep coming just 
as you want him to. In sum, your semi-bluff raise on fourth street 
has made subsequent cards that help you only moderately look 
very dangerous, while  it has made cards that give you a big 
hand look insignificant.
This last point is an additional benefit of the semi-bluff in 
stud games but especially in hold 'em. When you do hit the card 
that makes your hand, your opponent will often misread it because 
of your bet on the previous round (except in the cases where you 
were straightforwardly betting on the come with a flush or a 
straight draw). Thus, you may win a larger pot than you would 
have otherwise expected.
Both the semi-bluff and betting a marginal hand rather than 
risking giving a worse hand a free card are cases of the general 
precept that it is usually better to be betting than calling. By 
betting as a semi-bluff you have a chance of winning the pot right
On fourth street an opponent with
bets. You've caught the
98 Chapter Eleven
there, something you are usually hoping to do, and you have 
shown greater strength than you really have. If you catch scary-
looking cards after you have been called, you are still likely to win 
pots you wouldn't otherwise have won. When you bet now, your 
opponent is quite likely to fold. On the other hand, when you don't 
improve and are caught in a semi-bluff, that can be of value as an 
advertisement for the future.
A final advantage of the semi-bluff, as I suggested in the 
previous chapter, is that you can sometimes use it to get a free 
card. Let's say an opponent in hold 'em bets on the flop, and you 
raise with a four-flush. If that player calls your raise, it is likely he 
will check to you on fourth street. If you haven't made the flush, 
you have the option of checking behind him for a free card.
Semi-Bluffs and Pure Bluffs
A pure bluff is a bet, which, if called, has no chance of 
winning in a showdown. A semi-bluff is a bet with more cards to 
come which, if called, is probably not the best hand at the moment 
but has a reasonable chance of becoming the best hand.
Many expert players believe their bluffs should have negative 
expectation. They see them as a form of advertising that will lead 
to their being called on other occasions when they do have the 
best hand. However, I believe pure bluffs should have no worse 
than zero expectation as I shall explain in more detail in a later 
chapter. At the same time, I agree that bluffs are an important part 
of a player's game. If you never bluff, your opponents will always 
know you have a legitimate hand when you bet. They will be 
likely to play correctly on the basis of what you have in your 
hand, which is to their advantage and your disadvantage, 
according to the Fundamental Theorem of Poker.
Since it is correct to bluff occasionally so that you don't give 
away too much information when you bet with a legitimate hand, 
the question is when to do it. Clearly, you cannot establish a 
regular pattern of bluffing. Observant opponents will soon pick it 
up, and you will be caught bluffing too often to make it profitable.
The Semi-Bluff 99
Rather than try to guess when to bluff, especially against 
tough players, use your cards to randomize your play.  {See 
Chapter Nineteen, "Bluffing and Game Theory.") In early betting 
rounds, with more cards to come, the most convenient and 
profitable way to use your cards is to bluff when you have the 
kind of semi-bluff hands I have been discussing. Then you are still 
bluffing occasionally, you will get all the advertising you need, 
but you have the extra advantage of sometimes winning even 
when you do get caught.
There are numerous situations where a pure bluff would not 
work often enough to be profitable, but where a semi-bluff is 
more profitable than simply checking and hoping to draw out and 
win in the showdown. Suppose you are playing $ 10-$20 hold 'em. 
After six cards your hand has fallen apart; you have no win. There 
is one more card to come and $60 in the pot. So if you bet $20 as 
a pure bluff against a single opponent, you are getting 3-to-1 for 
your bet when he folds. The key question, then, is whether that 
opponent will fold often enough to make a bluff profitable in 
terms of the pot odds you are getting. Let's say you expect he will 
fold 20 percent of the time. That is, he will call four times out of 
five and fold once. Thus, the odds against getting away with a 
bluff are 4-to-1, while you are getting only $60-to-$20 or 3-to-1 
odds when you bet. Therefore, the play has negative expectation. 
In the long run it is unprofitable. (This is assuming you give up 
your bluff when you're called and don't bet on the end.)
Now instead of a busted hand with one more card to come, 
let's assume you are holding a hand that you assess as having a 30 
percent chance of winding up the winner — something like, say, 
a four-flush and a small pair. Again there is $60 in the pot, and 
you figure you have a 20 percent chance of stealing that $60 right 
there if you come out betting against a single opponent. Readers 
should see intuitively that a semi-bluff bet now turns into a 
profitable play. In fact, it is more profitable than simply checking 
and hoping to win in the showdown.
To make this point absolutely clear,  we'll do some 
arithmetic. We'll assume that if you check after six cards, your
100 Chapter Eleven
opponent will check behind you, and we'll ignore bets on the end 
on the assumption that you will fold when you don't make your 
hand and your opponent will fold when you do. We'll take 100 
identical situations where you check and hope to draw out and 
100 situations where you make a semi-bluff bet.
Take checking first. With $60 in the pot and a 30 percent 
chance of winning, you will average winning $60 30 times for a 
total of $1,800.
What happens when you bet? Well, since your semi-bluff has 
a 20 percent chance of making your opponent fold, you will 
average winning $60 immediately 20 out of the 100 times you try 
it for a total of $1,200. Of the 80 times your opponent calls your 
bet, you will average winning $80 (the $60 already in the pot plus 
the $20 called) 30 percent of the time and losing your $20 bet 70 
percent of the time. That works out to an $80 win 24 times and a 
$20 loss 56 times for a net win of $800. So after 100 identical 
situations, you will average winning $ 1,200 when your opponent 
folds, plus $800 when he calls for a total of $2,000, which is $200 
more than you would win by checking. That comes to only $2 per 
hand, but it is with such small edges that you increase your hourly 
rate and your profits at the end of the month and the year.
The important thing to notice from this example is that both 
a pure bluff by itself and a value bet by itself would be wrong. 
Had you bet as a pure bluff, you would be getting only 3-to-1 
odds for a wager that has only one chance in five of winning. Had 
you bet only for value — that is, with the certainty your opponent 
will call — you would also be making an incorrect play since you 
have estimated that you are a 7-to-3 underdog. You are wagering 
even money (your $20 bet for a $20 call) when the odds are 21/з-
to-1 against your winning. However, the combination of the two 
possibilities — namely, winning with a bluff or winning by 
improving to the best hand — makes a semi-bluff bet not just a 
good play but a mandatory one.
Just as a semi-bluff bet can be profitable, so too can a 
semi-bluff raise. Suppose in hold 'em you start with
which gives you a flush draw and an inside-straight draw (not to 
mention a straight-flush draw). If someone now bets, you should 
raise. Even if that person folds only 20 percent of the time, the 
combined possibilities of winning right there and of making the 
best hand when he calls turns raising in this spot into a more 
profitable play than just calling. In general, when there is a 
possibility of winning the hand right there, even a slight one, it is 
important to bet — or raise. What's more, sometimes when you 
think you are semi-bluffing, you are actually betting the best hand. 
Another consideration when deciding to semi-bluff is the size of 
the pot. The larger the pot, hence the bigger the pot odds you are 
getting, the smaller your chances of getting away with a semi-
bluff need to be to make the play profitable. Game theory 
suggests the opposite — that you should bluff less with a larger

and the flop comes
Everybody checks. The next card is the
102 Chapter Eleven
pot, assuming expert opponents. However, in practice most 
players do not adjust their calling strategy correctly to the size of 
the pot, which makes both semi-bluffs and pure bluffs more 
profitable when the pot is large.
When Not to Semi-Bluff
As we have seen, a semi-bluff can be profitable because it 
sometimes works as a bluff (when your opponent folds the best 
hand) and sometimes lets you improve to the best hand (when 
your opponent calls). It is the combination of these circumstances 
that makes the semi-bluff profitable. Therefore, it is important to 
realize that you usually don't semi-bluff if you are sure you are 
going to be called. Why? Because then the bluff aspect of your bet 
has vanished, you are betting only for value, and it is clearly 
incorrect to put more money in the pot on a hand you know to be 
the underdog. The only exception to this principle may occur in 
seven-card stud and razz, as we saw earlier, when your semi-bluff 
confuses your opponent on later rounds as he watches your board 
develop into what looks like the best hand.
It is also a good idea to semi-bluff less often when you are 
last to act, especially if many players have checked ahead of you. 
Not only do you have the opportunity to give yourself a free card 
in last position, but it's possible that somebody ahead of you was 
sandbagging with a big hand and will check-raise when you bet. 
In contrast, when you are in first position, you would be more 
inclined to bet with a semi-bluffing hand. Since you can't assure 
yourself of a free card in first position, you might as well become 
the aggressor and bet when the situation warrants it.
Summary
We'll summarize this somewhat lengthy chapter point by 
point.
The Semi-Bluff 103
1 A semi-bluff is a bet, raise, or check-raise with a wide variety 
of hands which you believe are not the best at the moment. 
However, they may win not only right there when your 
opponent folds but also in a showdown when they improve 
to the best hand. They may also win when your opponent 
folds on a later round after you catch a scare card that makes 
your hand look like the best hand.
1.A semi-bluff may be used in any game, but it may be used
only with more cards to come.
2.Sometimes   a   hand   with   which   you   think   you   are
semi-bluffing is in fact the best hand. By betting, you prevent
a worse hand from getting a free card.
3.If you have a hand that warrants a call when your opponent
bets, it is usually correct to bet yourself, particularly in first
position. You thereby gain the chance of winning the pot
immediately, and you show more strength than you actually
have, which can be to your advantage later.
4.Semi-bluffs allow you to be the bettor instead of the caller,
which nearly always puts you in a more advantageous
position.
5.Semi-bluffs are a good way to randomize your bluffs, for you
have the added equity of a possible win even when you are
called.
6.A semi-bluff can frequently be a profitable play in situations
where a pure bluff is not. Your extra out of outdrawing your
opponent can swing your mathematical expectation from the
minus to the plus side.
7.You usually do not semi-bluff when you are sure your
opponent will call. However, if there is a possibility that
104 Chapter Eleven
opponent will fold, you should bet — or raise — with a 
semi-bluffing hand, especially as the pot gets larger.
9. It is usually better to make a semi-bluff bet when you are first 
to act; when you are last, you have the opportunity of giving 
yourself a free card, and you may not want to risk the chance 
of an opponent check-raising you.
Chapter Twelve  
Defense Against 
the Semi-Bluff
The Power of the Semi-Bluff
Let's say you're playing seven-card stud. You have a pair of 
jacks, and on fifth street your opponent bets. You know he has a 
big hand. So your response is easy: You fold. Suppose you know 
your opponent is bluffing with nothing. Again your response is 
easy: You raise. Suppose you think he has you beat with two 
small pair, but you're getting sufficient pot odds for a call. So you 
call. Straightforward bets, straightforward responses.
But what if your opponent is not so straightforward? What if 
he's the kind of player who might be betting with a legitimate 
hand but might also be semi-bluffing? He's not always semi-
bluffing, of  course.  That  would  also  make  it  too  easy  to 
respond, because if you know an opponent is semi-bluffing when 
he bets, you can simply raise with anything, and he will probably 
fold. The problem arises when you think an opponent may be 
semi-bluffing but can't be sure he does not have a legitimate hand. 
What's more, if he doesn't have a legitimate hand now, he may 
get it later — or he may look like he's gotten it later.
It turns out there aren't many defenses against the semi-bluff, 
which is why it is such a powerful play. Frequently the best play 
against a possible semi-bluff is to fold, especially when the pot is 
small. All right, your opponent has beaten you. He may even have 
made you throw away the best hand. But if you call his bet, he has 
three other ways of beating you. He may in fact have had the best 
hand when he bet. He may have been semi-bluffing, but he now 
outdraws you. Or he may have been semi-bluffing, but he
106 Chapter Twelve
proceeds to catch scare cards that force you to fold. Therefore, 
though you may have thrown away what was the best hand at the 
moment, still your opponent had too many ways of beating you to 
justify your calling his bet.
Even when you think you are favored to have the best hand, 
it may be correct to fold. Let's say you think it's a little better than 
even money that your opponent is semi-bluffing. For convenience, 
we'll say you think there's a 52 percent chance he's semi-bluffing 
and a 48 percent chance he has a good hand. If he is semi-
bluffing,  you  figure  you're  a  6-to-5  favorite  to  beat  him. 
However,  if  he isn't semi-bluffing and  has  the hand he's 
representing, you're virtually locked out. Thus, 52 percent of the 
time you're a favorite to win. Should you call his bet? Many 
professionals as well as amateurs make the mistake of calling in 
such situations, but unless the pot is large, the correct play is to 
fold.
Let's  work  it  out  mathematically.  You  lose  almost 
automatically 48 percent of the time. Of the remaining 52 percent, 
you'll win an average of six out of 11 hands (since you estimate 
yourself to be a 6-to-5 favorite). In other words, you'll lose almost 
half the time when you're a slight favorite and virtually all of the 
time when you're a big underdog. You stand to win the hand only 
29 percent of the time in all. To call the bet then, you would need 
to be getting at least 7-to-3 effective odds from the pot, which is 
not very likely in an early betting round. Hence, the correct play 
would normally be to fold.
The Difficulty of 
Defending Against the Semi-Bluff
To  illustrate  the  difficulty  of  defending  against  the 
semi-bluff, we'll take a seven-card stud hand from our discussion 
of semi-bluffing in the preceding chapter and reverse roles:
Opponent
Suppose you bet on fourth street, and your opponent raises. 
Knowing your opponent is fully capable of semi-bluffing in this 
spot with something like a pair of 7s in the hole, you still should 
probably not call with a pair of 9s. He may in fact have a pair of 
queens or jacks. Or he may be semi-bluffing with a four-flush. 
The problem is that your pair of 9s is no favorite over a four-flush 
with a jack and a queen. Thus, if your opponent has a pair of 
jacks, a pair of queens, or two pair, you may lose because he 
already has you beat; and if he has a four-flush, you may lose 
because he outdraws you (which with his overcards as well, he's 
a favorite to do). Even if your opponent has nothing better than a 
gut-shot straight draw, your two 9s with a king kicker are not a 
hand to be excited about. Consequently, even though you suspect 
this opponent is semi-bluffing, it doesn't do you much good to 
call with a poor hand because you have two ways of losing: You 
may lose to a legitimate hand or by being outdrawn.
Defense Against the Semi-Bluff 107
You
108 Chapter Twelve
Suppose you grit your teeth, close your eyes, and call your 
opponent's bet. The dealer raps on the table and deals the next 
card:
Opponent
What in the world do you do now? That nine of spades your 
opponent caught is a very scary-looking card. It might have made 
your opponent a flush. It might have made him a straight. If it 
didn't help him at all, well, then he was probably betting on fourth 
street with jacks or queens so that now he has a big pair and at 
least a three-flush — maybe a four-flush. All you can do is check, 
and when your opponent bets, as he surely will, you will probably 
throw away your hand, perhaps cursing the poker gods for 
delivering the 9 to your opponent and not to you. So here is a third 
way a semi-bluffer can beat you — namely, by catching scare 
cards that force you to fold.
(If you don't remember the exact hand from the previous 
chapter, all your opponent has in the hole, it turns out, is
 
Knowing that, it would of course be incorrect to fold at this point 
with two 9s and an ace, king kicker. Your opponent's semi-bluff 
on fourth street, followed by his semi-bluff on fifth street, caused
Defense Against the Semi-Bluff 109
you to make a mistake, according to the Fundamental Theorem of 
Poker, in contrast to what you would have done if you could see 
your opponent's hand. Your opponent gained, and you lost. 
However, not knowing what your opponent had, you did make the 
only sensible play.)
The Semi-Bluff Raise as a 
Defense Against the Semi-Bluff
While the confrontation just described shows the difficulty of 
defending against the semi-bluff, it also demonstrates one of the 
best defensive counter-strategies against it—the semi-bluff raise. 
Notice that when you bet into a
with a pair of 9s in the hole
and K,5 showing, you were semi-bluffing yourself. You were 
trying to represent kings in the hope that your opponent would 
fold with a pair of queens, a pair of jacks, or a worse hand. It turns 
out your opponent did have a worse hand — a pair of 7s and a 
three-flush. But what did he do instead of folding? He raised. He 
made a semi-bluff raise into a possible pair of kings with a three-
flush and a small pair. Of course, if you had really had two kings, 
he'd be in trouble. But since you were semi-bluffing yourself, as 
your opponent suspected, his semi-bluff raise turned the tables on 
you. It put you on the defensive and him in the driver's seat.
To elucidate the effect of this type of play further, we'll talk 
about stealing the antes. Stealing antes is one form of the 
semi-bluff. A player raises immediately, representing a strong 
hand, and makes it too expensive, given the size of the pot, for a 
mediocre hand to continue. A simple example would be from 
seven-card razz, where the high card typically has to make a small 
bet to start the action and a low card usually raises.
Let's say I have a low card showing, with a second low card 
and a king in the hole. One player behind me also has a low card 
showing. With a two-card low, I do not have a legitimate hand, 
but nevertheless, I'm in a profitable semi-bluffing situation 
because I suspect that if I raise, one of two things can happen. The
You
110 Chapter Twelve
low card might fold behind me, in which case I win the antes 
immediately since the high cards will also fold. Or the low card 
might call, in which case I'm in trouble.
However, all is not lost because my bet was not a pure bluff 
but a semi-bluff. I have an extra chance to win if I catch a little 
card on the next round and my opponent catches a big card.
When I bet at that point, my opponent is likely to fold. If he 
calls, well, we both presumably have three-card lows, so I can't 
be too much of an underdog. I may still make the best low hand 
and win in the showdown.
When you semi-bluff, then, you are looking to win in one of 
three ways — by making your opponents fold, by catching a scare 
card on the next round to make them fold, or by drawing out on 
them and producing the best hand in the showdown. This 
combination of possibilities makes you the favorite when you 
raise.
But what happens when, instead of calling my raise, that low 
card behind me reraises? Suddenly my semi-bluff has been 
shattered.
When you reraise a possible semi-bluff in such situations, 
your opponent is pretty much forced to fold when you've caught 
him without a legitimate hand. For instance, in seven-card stud a 
player with
Defense Against the Semi-Bluff 111
you are applying pressure on him to fold or call with the worst 
hand. Of course, we can take this situation a step further. The 
original semi-bluffer could make a semi-bluff reraise if he thinks 
there's a reasonable chance the obvious pair of jacks will give up 
and fold.
Observe, though, that in none of these instances is a simple 
call any kind of a defense when you suspect you're up against a 
possible semi-bluff. You should not say to yourself, "This may be 
a semi-bluff, and I may have the best hand. Therefore, I'll call." 
When you call, you are faced with the problem that your opponent 
may subsequently make the best hand if he doesn't have it already 
or he may look like he's made it. However, when you raise, you 
probably take away these latter two possibilities. An opponent 
will call — or perhaps reraise — with a legitimate hand, but he 
will very possibly fold if he was semi-bluffing. Even if he does 
call, it is with the worse hand. Another advantage to your raise is 
that it will deter your opponent from semi-bluffing against you in 
the future, and still another is that you are getting more money in 
the pot when an opponent calls with a worse hand.
To repeat, when you suspect an opponent may be semi-
bluffing, you still have to fold most of your hands — like that 
pair of 9s earlier in the chapter. However, when you have a hand 
that is worth a call, in most cases you should raise. This is just 
one of many situations in poker where, when folding is not the 
best play, raising is, and calling is the worst of the three 
alternatives.
There is a situation that frequently comes up in hold 'em 
which calls for a semi-bluff raise. You're in last position, and you 
pick up something like
may raise against a jack showing in an attempt to steal the antes. 
Even if the jack calls, the semi-bluffer may catch an ace or a king 
on the next card, giving him the best hand against two jacks, or he 
may catch a scare card like a queen suited with the king. 
Therefore, you should usually reraise with a decent hand like two 
jacks. If the king is semi-bluffing and doesn't have two jacks beat,
112 Chapter Twelve
Defense Against the Semi-Bluff 113
a pretty fair starting hand. Suddenly the man to your right raises, 
and you suspect he's using his late position to try to steal the 
antes. Since your hand is too good to fold, you must reraise. You 
must not let the first raiser have that extra double chance of 
winning on a semi-bluff. Similarly, as we saw earlier, if you're the 
last low card in razz and the next-to-last low card raises, very 
possibly as a semi-bluff, you cannot simply call with a decent 
hand and give your opponent two extra ways of winning. Even 
with a hand as marginal as
you must reraise to make that player fold or pay with his poor 
hands.
You gain another advantage when you make this kind of 
response. You do not want to have an opponent who is semi-
bluffing with the correct frequency. By picking off his semi-
bluffs, you reduce the times he'll try it on those occasions when 
he ought to. Your reraise has forced him to think twice about 
semi-bluffing  in  the  future.  (See  Chapters  Eighteen  and 
Nineteen.)
When to Fold and 
When to Raise
We have said, up to this point, that the two main defenses 
against the semi-bluff are simply giving up and folding, or raising. 
(In all cases we are assuming the pot is relatively small.) The 
question now is when to do the one and when to do the other. 
That is, when do you fold, and when do you raise?
Obviously when you have a very poor hand, you fold. When 
you have a big hand, you raise unless it's so big you want to 
slowplay and trap your opponent later. The difficult decisions 
occur when you have a medium-value hand. There are three 
principle criteria you should use in deciding whether to raise or
fold:
1.The chances your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing.
2.The chances that opponent will outdraw you if he is betting
with the worst hand.
3.The chances you will outdraw that opponent if he is betting
the best hand.
The more you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-
bluffing, and the greater your chances of outdrawing him if he 
does have a legitimate hand, the more you will tend to raise. On 
the other hand, the smaller these chances are and the greater the 
chances your opponent will outdraw you if he is betting the worst 
hand, the more you would tend to fold. Recall an example earlier 
in this chapter. The chances that your opponent had the best 
hand  were  quite  high  (48  percent);  the  chances  of  your 
outdrawing him were so low as to be virtually nonexistent. At the 
same time the chances of your opponent outdrawing you were 
very high (you were only a 6-to-5 favorite if he didn't already 
have you beat). It was the combination of all these chances that 
dictated a fold.
Exceptions When 
Calling is Correct
We have said that either folding or raising is the correct play 
against a possible semi-bluff most of the time. There are three 
situations in which just calling would be correct.
114 Chapter Twelve
Calling a Possible
Semi-Bluff When the Pot is Large
First, you would call when the pot is large, even if there's a 
chance your opponent is semi-bluffing. Possessing any kind of 
competitive hand yourself, you certainly don't want to give away 
a big pot to a possible semi-bluff. So you can't fold. At the same 
time, there is no point in risking a raise since, because of the size 
of the pot, your opponent will call even if he is semi-bluffing. And 
if he's not semi-bluffing but has the best hand, he may reraise 
you. Therefore, the only play is to call.
Calling a
Possible Bet On the Come
Secondly, in stud and hold 'em games, it is usually a mistake 
to raise with a good but not a great hand when you think your 
opponent — particularly a very tough opponent — has bet or 
raised on the come for a flush or a straight. If his bet was 
legitimate, he probably has you beat, so you're simply donating 
money to the pot. If he was on the come, he has an easy call of 
your raise, which eliminates most of the reasons for you to make 
it. Thus, even if you were quite sure that the
earlier in
this chapter had only a four-flush, you would not be correct in 
raising. You would only call.
However, when you call an opponent who you think is on the 
come, you usually do so with the intention of betting right out on 
the next round any time that opponent draws a blank card that 
would not make his hand if he was in fact on the come. You now 
become the favorite if your opponent was on the come, and you 
don't want to give him a free card.
There is a mathematical reason for you to play your hand this 
way. Let's say you bet with two cards to come, and someone 
raises you. You estimate that there is a one-third chance that
Defense Against the Semi-Bluff 115
player has you beat and a two-thirds chance he is on a draw. 
Nevertheless in most cases he is still a mathematical favorite. So 
you can only call the raise since you're the underdog. However, 
when the next card cannot have made his flush or straight if he 
was drawing to it, now, with only one card to come, you have 
reverted to being the favorite. So you should usually bet. On the 
other hand, if that card makes the possible flush or straight, you 
should usually check and fold if your opponent bets, unless you 
are getting good enough pot odds to chase. Your opponent almost 
certainly has you beat, whether he was originally betting a 
legitimate hand or betting on the come.
Here is an example of this calling defense against a possible 
semi-bluff that came up when I was playing recently in a 
seven-stud game. I started with a three-flush and a 10 showing 
and was lucky enough to make three 8s on fifth street. I bet, and 
a good player who caught a
with the
as his door 
card  raised. I reasoned the raise meant one of three things. 
Either my opponent had started with kings in the hole, in which 
case he was raising with the best hand; or he had started with two 
jacks, made kings up, and raised, figuring I was betting 10s and 
8s; or he had a flush or a straight draw. I called the raise. When 
no heart, ace, or 9 fell on sixth street, which might make a straight 
or flush, I bet right out, much to my opponent's surprise, for my 
opponent had been expecting to get a free card. It turned out the 
opponent was in fact on a flush draw with a small pair, and the 
three 8s held up. (Of course, if a heart, ace, or 9 had fallen, the 
play in this instance would have been to check and call since 
there was a reasonable chance for me to make a full house on 
the last card.)
The Delayed Semi-Bluff Raise
A third case in which calling against a possible semi-bluff 
might be a good play is what I might call the delayed semi-bluff 
raise. It's a play I make against very tough players who frequently 
semi-bluff and who are thoroughly familiar with the ordinary 
semi-bluff raise as a response to their semi-bluffs.
116 Chapter Twelve
Defense Against the Semi-Bluff 117
Here's how it works. In seven-card stud I might have a queen 
showing and a queen in the hole, giving me a pair of queens, 
and  an opponent with a king showing raises. I suspect this 
person might be semi-bluffing with maybe a small pair or even 
less, but I just call. On the next card we both catch blanks, 
and the opponent comes out firing. What I do now is raise! I 
raise with a pair of queens into a possible pair of kings. It may 
seem like a strange play, but it adds a confusing twist to the 
ordinary semi-bluff raise. When I called the first bet, my 
opponent  suspected I had queens though I could have had 
something like a three-flush. Now when I raise him on fourth 
street, my opponent has to wonder whether I've made queens up. 
Unless he really does have two kings, he can't conceivably call 
with something like ace, king high. And I want him to fold even if 
my pair of queens is the  best hand. I want him to make a 
mistake according to the  Fundamental Theorem of Poker, 
because with a couple of overcards or with, say, a small pair 
and one overcard, he is getting sufficient odds for a call.
Suppose, though, my opponent really does have kings. Well, 
I'm not in the best of shape, but my opponent most likely won't 
reraise, fearing I have queens up. Furthermore, he'll check to me 
on the next round if his hand hasn't improved, and I can get 
myself a free card. Should this card happen to give me an open 
pair, it would be very difficult even for a pair of kings to call my 
bet since it looks as if there's a good chance I've now made a full 
house.
Summary
While calling may be a good defense against the semi-bluff 
in situations similar to the three described, remember that 
normally the correct play is to fold with marginal hands, and if 
folding isn't correct, then you should raise. We'll conclude this 
chapter with an example of each response to the possible 
semi-bluff:
Opponent
Your opponent 
bets. How should you play?
You should fold without hesitation. Even though your 
opponent may be betting a four-flush or a straight draw, you have 
too many ways to lose. Your opponent might not even get the 
flush or straight but make a pair of 10s or kings to beat you:

Your opponent bets when he pairs the 5s. How should you play? 
Your should raise. If your opponent has only one pair, you 
want to make it expensive for him to draw another card, perhaps 
even forcing him to fold. If he does have two pair smaller than 
your kings, you're not that much of an underdog. He may even 
fold two small pair. If he does call with them, he figures to check 
to you on the next round, giving you a chance to take a free card. 
The only hands he might have that are real trouble for you are 
aces up and three 5s, but there is no reason to think he has them:
Hold 'em

Defense Against the Semi-Bluff 119
You bet, and your opponent raises. How should you play?
The question you are facing here is whether your opponent 
has a flush draw, an open-ended straight draw, or something like 
10,9 — or whether he has a better hand than yours, something like 
an A, 10, a K,10, two pair, or three-of-a-kind. Since the combined 
chances of your being beat already or being outdrawn make your 
opponent the favorite at this point, you should call rather than 
raise. But on the next card you should come right out betting, 
unless a heart, 6, 9, or jack falls. If your opponent raises again, 
you should usually fold; most players won't bluff or semi-bluff a 
second time in this spot.
When someone bets or raises but may be semi-bluffing, your 
decision is one of the trickiest in poker. You must choose whether 
to fold; raise; reraise; call and bet on the next round; call and 
check-raise on the next round; call and then check and call on the 
next round; or call and fold on the next round if the card your 
opponent catches would make the hand with which he might have 
been semi-bluffing. Making the correct decision consistently 
separates the true champion from the merely good player.

Raising
According to the Fundamental Theorem of Poker, you gain 
when your opponents play a hand differently from the way they 
would if they knew what you had. Any time you raise, for 
whatever specific tactical reason, you are doing so to avoid 
making a mistake yourself, according to the Fundamental 
Theorem, and to cause your opponents to make mistakes. There 
are numerous reasons for raising. Many have been discussed in 
various contexts in earlier chapters. In this chapter we will review 
all these reasons and explain several of them in more detail. We 
will also explain how raising is an extension of the Fundamental 
Theorem of Poker.
We reduce the principal reasons for raising to seven:
1.To get more money in the pot when you have the best hand.
2.To drive out opponents when you have the best hand.
3.To bluff or semi-bluff.
4.To get a free card.
5.To gain information.
6.To drive out worse hands when your own hand may be
second best.
7.To drive out better hands when a come hand bets.
Now let's look at each of these reasons individually.
Raising to Get More 
Money in the Pot
Getting more money in the pot is the primary reason to raise 
when you think you have the best hand. Clearly you would raise 
a single opponent on the end with what you think is the best hand,
121
122 Chapter Thirteen
but on earlier rounds you must always decide whether it's worth 
giving your hand away to get another bet or two in the pot. (See 
Chapter Eight, "The Value of Deception," and Chapter Fifteen, 
"Slowplaying.") Essentially, the decision to raise on an early 
round depends upon the size of the pot and how big a favorite you 
think your hand is.
Ironically, the better your hand, the more reason you would 
have for not raising on an early round. If you think opponents will 
call another player's bet but fold if you raise, and if at the same 
time you figure they aren't getting sufficient pot odds to call a bet 
if they knew what you had, then you should not raise. You should 
give them the opportunity to make the mistake of calling. 
However, if they are getting correct pot odds to call a single bet, 
which is most often the case, you should raise even if they are still 
getting sufficient pot odds to call both the bet and the raise. In this 
instance, you're rooting for them to fold, but when they do call, 
you're at least getting more money in a pot you expect to win 
most of the time. Then again, by all means raise if you expect an 
opponent who shouldn't even call a single bet to call a raise. You 
might as well get as much money from a hopeless chaser as you 
possibly can. Similarly, when you get heads-up with one opponent 
in a limit game, it is generally correct to raise if you think you 
have the best hand to make your opponent fold hands with which 
he might outdraw you.
As the pot gets larger and larger, it becomes less and less 
important to disguise your big hands and more and more 
important to get even more money in the pot. Often with a large 
pot, you're rooting for opponents to fold when you raise, for 
they're probably getting sufficient pot odds to call. However, 
whether you hope they fold or hope they call, the size of the pot 
is likely to keep them around to see another card. Therefore, it is 
usually correct to raise with what you think is the best hand and 
get more money into a large pot even if it tends to give your hand 
away.
Raising 123
Getting More Money In 
the Pot By Not Raising
Sometimes — even with no more cards to come — you can 
get more money or at least as much money into a multi-way pot 
by calling instead of raising, and at the same time avoid the risk 
of a reraise from the original bettor. You go for the overcall. That 
is, you call instead of raising in order to extract money from one 
or more of the players still in the pot behind you.
Suppose, after all the cards are out, the bettor to your right 
appears to have a hand you can beat. If you raise, that player will 
probably call, but if he reraises, you're in trouble. At the same 
time, there are two players to your left whom you know you have 
beat. You also know they will call if you call, but they will fold if 
you raise. In such a situation it becomes absolutely incorrect to 
raise. You should only call. By calling you figure to win two extra 
bets from the players behind you, but by raising you will win only 
one extra bet at most when the original bettor calls your raise, 
which he may not even do. What's more, your raise could cost 
you two bets if the original bettor reraises and you fold, or three 
bets if he reraises and you call with the second best hand. It could 
also cost you two bets if the original bettor calls your raise and 
turns out to have the best hand.
The situation at the end need not be so extreme as the one 
just described to make a flat call correct. Let's look at the 
following hands:
Seven-Card Stud
Bettor
Player Behind You
If you raise with your A,Q high-heart flush, the third player 
will probably fold, and the original bettor may throw away a small 
straight and not pay you off either. So you may not gain a thing by 
raising; at most you'll win one extra bet. And what if the original 
bettor reraises, which he will do if he has, for example, an A,K 
high flush, especially since he knows you cannot have the king of 
hearts? (It's in the third player's hand.) By raising you lose two or 
three bets instead of the one you would have lost by calling. 
Furthermore, by just calling, you figure to win one bet from the 
player behind you when he calls too. So you gain exactly as much 
as you could have gained by raising, while you risk nothing.
In general, you should not usually raise but try for the 
overcall whenever all the cards are out and your hand is clearly 
better than any hand that might overcall behind you but not 
clearly better than the bettor's.
However, you must realize that to go for the overcall, you 
must be sure you have the player or players to your left beat. If 
there is some chance one of them has a better hand than yours but 
might not call your raise, it is critical that you do raise when you
Raising 125
have a decent chance of having the original bettor beaten. You 
certainly don't want an overcall if it will cost you the pot.
Raising to Drive Out Opponents
When you raise to get people out, what you are really doing 
is raising to cut down their odds. In fact, you may sometimes cut 
their odds so severely that you hope they will call rather than fold 
after you raise.
By cutting down a person's odds, we mean reducing the 
amount of money he may win per dollar invested. For example, 
if there is a $100 pot, someone bets $10, and you call the $10, the 
player behind you gets 12-to-l odds on a call. That is, that player 
hopes to win $120 from his $10 call, or $12 per $1 invested. But 
suppose you raise the initial bettor, making it $20 for the player 
behind you to call. Now there's $130 in the pot instead of $120, 
but the player behind you must invest twice as much — $20 — for 
a chance to win it. You have thus cut his odds almost in half— 
from $120-to-$10 to $130-to-$20, or from 12-to-l to 61/2-to-l. In 
so doing, you have created a situation where the player may make 
a mistake, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Poker, by 
either calling or folding. Even when he folds correctly after you 
raise because he is getting insufficient pot odds to call a double 
bet, you certainly prefer that to his calling an unraised bet 
correctly and proceeding to outdraw you and win the pot.
Raising as a Means of 
Cutting Down Opponents' Odds
To illustrate this important point, we'll examine a hand from 
five card draw poker. You have a pat flush; the player to your 
right has nothing at all, and the player to your left has two pair. 
For the purposes of this illustration, we'll assume you know 
exactly what both opponents have. We'll also assume the betting 
limit is a flat $10 but that somehow a $100 pot has been created
124 Chapter Thirteen
You
126 Chapter Thirteen
before betting gets under way. With the cards out, we'll say the 
chances of the two pair improving to a full house are 9-to-1 
against. In other words, the player behind you will improve to the 
best hand one out of ten times on average.
With absolutely nothing, the player to your right bets $10 in 
an attempt to steal that big pot. You know this player will fold 
instantly if you raise, and you are fairly sure the player behind you 
will fold too. However, if you just call the $10, the player behind 
you will also call. Consequently, you may win $120 plus perhaps 
another bet at the end if you call, whereas if you raise you'll most 
likely have to make do with the $110 already in the pot. Should 
you call or raise?
The answer, of course, is you should raise, but let's look at 
the problem logically. The opponent with two pair is a 9-to-1 
underdog. If you call, there is $120 in the pot. He would be 
getting 12-to-l from the pot for his call when the odds against his 
making the best hand are only 9-to-1. Therefore, if you call and he 
calls behind you, he is making the correct play, the play with 
positive expectation. He will lose $10 in nine hands out of ten 
on average, for a total loss of $90, but he will win $120 in one 
hand out of ten for a net profit of $30. He gains on the play, 
and according to the Fundamental Theorem of Poker, any time 
your opponent gains, you are costing yourself money.
On the other hand, when you raise, making it $20 for the two 
pair to call, you are cutting that player's pot odds from $120-to-
$10, or 12-to-l, to $130-to-$20, or 61/2-to-1. Since the two pair is 
a 9-to-1 underdog and is now getting only 61/2-to-1 from the pot, 
you have made it correct for the two pair to fold. If he plays 
correctly and does fold, you do better, as we shall see presently, 
than if you had played incorrectly and allowed him sufficient odds 
for a call. However, if the two pair plays incorrectly and calls after 
you raise, you do best of all, because when an opponent makes a 
mistake, you gain. What your raise did was to reduce correct odds 
for a call into incorrect odds for a call. The curious effect of this 
turnabout is that although you raised to drive the two pair out, you 
are rooting for him to call after you raise.
Raising 127
To prove this point, let's see what happens over ten average 
hands if:
1.You call, and the two pair calls behind you.
2.You raise, and the two pair folds.
3.You raise, and the two pair calls your raise.
If you call and the two pair calls, you will win nine out of ten 
hands. Assuming you check after the draw and don't pay your 
opponent off the one time he makes a full house, you will win 
$120 (the $110 already in the pot — not counting your own $10 
call — plus the two pair's $10 call) nine times for a total of 
$1,080, and you will lose $10 once. Your net profit is $1,070.
If you raise and the two pair folds, you will win all ten hands, 
which at $110 per hand comes to $1,100. You win $30 more than 
you would if you called and the two pair overcalled.
If you raise and the two pair calls, you win $130 (the $110 
already in the pot plus the two pair's $20 call of a double bet) nine 
times for a total of $1,170 and lose $20 once for a net profit of 
$ 1,150. You win $80 more than you do when you call and the two 
pair overcalls and $50 more than when you raise and your 
opponent folds.
Taking the $1,100 profit as the norm (since both you and 
your opponent play correctly in that case), we can say you lose 
$30 over ten hands or $3 per hand when you play incorrectly and 
only call, and you win $50 over ten hands or $5 per hand when 
your opponent plays incorrectly and calls your raise. To repeat, 
when you raise to drive people out, you are actually raising to cut 
down their odds. If they fold, that's fine, but sometimes you have 
cut their odds to a point where you are rooting for them to call 
after you raise. In no-limit games you can control the odds you are 
giving your opponents by the amount you bet, and you frequently 
find yourself rooting for them to call your raise even though you 
would be rooting for them to fold if you had just called.
Of course, it is correct just to call, as I did in the no-limit hold
em hand of Chapter Three, when you know your opponent will
fold if you raise but would make a mistake by overcalling if he
128 Chapter Thirteen
knew what your cards were. You want to give your opponent 
every opportunity to make a mistake since that mistake is your 
gain even if he happens to get lucky and win an individual hand 
because of that mistake. In poker as in any game of skill with an 
element of chance, you cannot play results. That is, you cannot 
judge the value of a play because of the way it works out in a 
specific instance. In backgammon, for example, it's possible for 
a player to make a mistake or a series of mistakes that results in 
a hopeless position from which he can extricate himself only by 
rolling double six. The odds against rolling a double six are 35-to-
1. If the hapless player happens to roll that double six and go on 
to victory, you cannot say he played the game correctly, anymore 
than you can say a person who puts his money on number 20 on 
the roulette layout plays correctly when number 20 happens to 
come up. Both players were just very, very lucky.
To summarize this section, when you raise to drive people 
out, you are really cutting down their odds. So you should raise 
with what you think is the best hand only when opponents are 
getting good enough odds to overcall or when you think an 
opponent will call a double bet even though he shouldn't even call 
a single bet.
Raising to Bluff or Semi-Bluff
Raising as a pure bluff with a hand that has no chance of 
winning if called is a tricky play, too risky to be attempted often. 
It is usually done only when there are no more cards to come, 
often when you didn't make the hand you were hoping to make 
but are trying to convince your opponent you did. Presumably 
your opponent has a decent hand to bet into you and is reluctant 
to throw it away when you raise. In limit poker, raising as a pure 
bluff can succeed often enough to be profitable only against a 
very tough player who is capable of making super-tough folds. 
The weaker the player, the more likely he is to call your raise with 
any kind of hand.
Raising 129
Pure bluff raises are a more important part of no-limit poker. 
Indeed some world-class no-limit players, like 1982 poker 
champion Jack Straus, are famous for their ability to bluff raise 
successfully. However, the fact that bluff raises are more 
important in no-limit than in limit doesn't make them any less 
difficult or tricky to use; it only makes them more costly when 
they are misused. (See Chapters Eighteen and Nineteen for a 
further discussion of bluff raises and bluffing in general.)
The semi-bluff raise is a more significant and frequently used 
part of a good poker player's arsenal. As with the pure bluff, you 
make a semi-bluff raise in the hope of winning the pot right there, 
but in contrast to the pure bluff, you always semi-bluff with more 
cards to come and with a hand that can improve, so there is a 
reasonable chance you will outdraw your opponent and win the 
pot even when you are called.
As we observed in the last chapter, the semi-bluff raise can 
also be a good defense against someone else who may be semi-
bluffing. When you raise a possible semi-bluffer, that player 
usually has to throw away a semi-bluff hand. When he calls your 
raise, you can be pretty sure he has what he's representing. So an 
added benefit to your semi-bluff raise is that you have gained a bit 
of information. Furthermore, your opponent may fear you have 
the best hand, and check to you on the next round, giving you the 
chance to take a free card.
Thus, even though you may not achieve your primary goal 
when you raise — in this instance, making your opponent fold a 
semi-bluff hand — you often achieve secondary goals — such as 
gaining information and getting a free card. Similarly, when you 
raise to drive worse hands out but one of your opponents calls 
(and is getting proper odds for the call), you have at least achieved 
the secondary goal of getting more money in a pot you think you 
are the favorite to win.
130 Chapter Thirteen
Raising to Get a Free Card
As we just noted, when your semi-bluff raise is called, it may 
have allowed you the opportunity to get a free card on the next 
round. However, when you're thinking of raising specifically to 
get a free card, you should keep in mind two considerations — 
your position and the cost of the raise.
To get a free card, you must be last to act; if you are not last 
and you check, you will have shown weakness. A player behind 
you with a better hand than yours will probably bet, denying you 
the chance for a free card. In hold 'em, you can always be sure of 
your position since it's fixed throughout a hand, but in games like 
seven-card stud and razz, you often have no guarantee you will be 
last to act from one round to the next. In seven stud, for instance, 
the player to your left may have a king high to start the betting, 
but on the next card the player to your right or you yourself catch 
an ace. Now you must lead off, which you certainly do not want 
to do if you're still banking on a free card. So if you have some 
doubt about securing last position on the next round, raising to get 
a free card can just cost you money needlessly when it turns out 
you're not last after all.
Which brings up the second consideration when you're 
thinking of raising to get a free card — namely, that that free card 
is not free at all. It costs you the price of your raise. So unless you 
have other reasons for raising, you would make the play only 
when the cost of the raise now is cheaper than what you'd have to 
pay for a call on the next round. In a $10-$20 hold 'em game, for 
example, in which the bet doubles on fourth street, you might 
raise $10 after the flop to avoid paying $20 to call a bet on the 
next round.
Of course, you need not take advantage of the free card 
option. You certainly wouldn't when you catch the card that 
makes your hand. Nor would you when you catch a card that 
looks as if it makes your hand. For example, the holder of the pair 
of black 7s with
showing, a hand we discussed in the
preceding two chapters, probably knew he had the worst hand and
Raising 131
might have taken a free card in the hope of making a flush, but he 
found it much more profitable to continue the semi-bluff and bet 
after the
hit, since only an opponent with a very strong 
hand could risk a call.
Raising to Gain Information
Raising simply to gain information is a tricky play and 
shouldn't be done often. Generally you should consider any 
information gained as an extra benefit of a raise you are making 
for other reasons.
There are occasions, though, when you cost yourself less by 
raising to gain information early than you would if you had not 
led your opponent into giving his hand away. These occasions 
usually occur in heads-up situations and only in early betting 
rounds. Furthermore, your opponent should be the type of player 
whose response to your raise is likely to reflect the hand he is 
holding. Otherwise your raise could very well give you wrong 
information.
What can you learn by raising? Well, if your opponent calls, 
he probably has a good hand. If he reraises, he probably has a very 
good hand. (It's for this reason you cannot raise to gain 
information when your opponent is the sort of player who is 
capable of a semi-bluff reraise.) If your opponent folds, that, of 
course, tells you he's weak, and you take down the money. An 
added benefit to raising to gain information is that sometimes your 
opponent may fold marginal hands that he shouldn't have folded.
You invest in an early raise to gain information in order to 
save yourself money later. If, for example, you call on fourth 
street in seven stud, you may continue to call three more bets only 
to discover in the showdown that you didn't have a chance from 
the beginning. But a raise on fourth street followed by a call or a 
reraise from your opponent allows you to play your hand knowing 
you're up against considerable strength. Depending upon your 
own strength, you can then decide whether and how long it's 
worth continuing in the hand.
132 Chapter Thirteen
Let's say with a pair of kings on fourth street in seven-card 
stud you raise an open pair of 9s. Your opponent reraises. You 
decide that opponent has three 9s and fold. By risking one bet 
(your raise), you save as many as three bets you might otherwise 
have called on fifth street, sixth street, and on the end. Your 
savings is even greater when the bet doubles after fourth street. A 
trial-balloon raise on a $10 round could save you three $20 calls 
later.
Nevertheless, raising just to gain information is tricky. For 
example, if that open pair of 9s just calls your raise, can you be 
sure that opponent doesn't have three 9s? What to do on the next 
round may still not be clear to you. That is why you should 
generally reserve your raises for other purposes and consider 
whatever information you gain from your opponents' responses 
as an added benefit.
Raising to Drive Out 
Worse Hands When Your 
Own May Be Second Best
Depending on the size of the pot and your assessment of your 
own and your opponents' hands, it may be correct to raise with 
what you believe may be the second-best hand if you can get the 
third-, fourth- and fifth-best hands out. The reasons for this play 
were suggested in an earlier chapter. If, for instance, the bettor has 
a 50 percent chance of winning the pot, you have a 30 percent 
chance, and two other hands each have a 10 percent chance, you 
improve your chances by driving those two worst hands out with 
a raise. Now the best hand may have a 60 percent chance of 
winning, but you've improved your own chances to 40 percent. In 
seven stud you may, for instance, have two kings against a 
probable two small pair. Two other players behind you appear to 
be drawing to straights. By raising them out, you almost surely 
win when you improve to kings up and may win when it turns out 
your single opponent had only one pair and, say, a flush draw.
Raising 133
However, if the straight draws stay in, you may lose with kings up 
against an unimproved two pair when one of the straights gets 
there.
Raising to Drive
Out Better Hands
When a Come Hand Bets
Let's say on fifth street in seven stud you have two 10s, and 
the player to your right bets with an obvious flush draw. You 
know there are a couple of players behind you with higher pairs 
than yours. Nevertheless, you may be in a position to raise if you 
think the better hands will fold rather than call a double bet. When 
they do fold, you become the favorite heads-up against the come 
hand, and if that player misses his flush, your raise on fifth street 
has won you the pot. The player betting on the come was 
expecting at least two callers in order to get proper odds for his 
bet. Your raise turns that bet into a mistake since he is not getting 
a proper return for his investment. At the same time, when the 
players behind you fold after you raise, they too are making a 
mistake since their hands are better than yours.
On the other hand, if you suspect one or both of the higher 
pairs behind you will call your raise, not only should you not 
raise, you should not even call the original bet since you are beat 
in two places and may get beat in a third. This somewhat rare 
situation is one of those times when your only alternatives are to 
raise or fold. It is a time when a call is patently incorrect.
Raising Versus 
Folding or Calling
Raising is often a better alternative than folding, with calling 
the worst of the three. Such situations occur frequently when there 
are several players in the pot. Thus, when you raise with two 10s
134 Chapter Thirteen
against someone betting on the come and succeed in driving better 
hands out, you show a profit on the hand in the long run. 
However, when you don't want to try this play, calling cannot be 
profitable because you are too big an underdog.
Similarly, we have noted it may be correct to raise with what 
is possibly the second-best hand if your raise will drive third-, 
fourth-, and fifth-best hands out — usually straight and/or flush 
draws. However, if you know those players are not going to get 
out when you raise, all of a sudden your hand might not be worth 
even a call. Not only is there a good chance you're already beat by 
the bettor, but frequently you'll get caught from behind by one of 
the drawing hands. When you cannot get the drawing hands out 
by raising, you have so many ways of losing that your best 
alternative is to fold.
Let's say in five-card draw you have two 3s and two 2s 
before the draw. You are in a game where people are going to 
come in behind you with medium-sized pairs. If you want to play 
the hand, you must raise to drive all medium-sized pairs out. In 
this case you're not interested in cutting down your opponents' 
odds, because you can never cut them down sufficiently as far as 
your hand is concerned. You want them out of the hand, pure and 
simple. If they stay, you have too many ways to lose since any 
two pair beat you unless you hit a lucky 11-to-l shot and make a 
full house. Therefore, if for some reason you choose not to raise 
or if you think raising will not drive out the people with the 
medium pairs, then your only alternative is to throw away your 
two tiny pair. They simply have too little chance of winning in a 
multi-way pot to make it worth calling. You must either raise or 
fold.
As we discussed previously, raising is better than calling 
against a possible semi-bluff when your hand is too good to fold. 
It is better for a variety of reasons. It gives you control of the 
hand. It sometimes allows you to win the pot right there. It allows 
you to take a free card on the next round when you need to. It 
prevents your opponent from getting a cheap card that will beat 
you when he is on a semi-bluff. It disguises your hand so that you
Raising 135
might very well win when a worthless scare card falls. Raising 
against a possible semi-bluff is so much better than calling (except 
in the three situations described at the end of the last chapter) that 
unless you can raise, you're usually better off folding.
Frequently a semi-bluff raise is indicated even though a call 
would be clearly unprofitable. Let's say you have a four-flush 
with one card to come. You know the odds against making the 
flush are 4-to-1, and your opponent bets $20 into a $40 pot. That 
is, he's offering you 3-to-1 odds on a 4-to-1 shot. You cannot 
usually call the bet since a call has negative expectation unless 
you are almost sure of winning a double bet on the end when you 
hit the flush. In 100 identical situations you will win only 20 times 
on average and lose 80 times. That is, you will win $60 20 times 
for a total of $1,200, and you will lose $20 80 times for a total of 
$ 1,600. Your net loss will be $400 or $4 per hand. So the decision 
is clear. People who make such calls are perennial losers.
Of course, if you fold, you lose nothing beyond the money 
you put into the pot in earlier betting rounds. But suppose you 
read your opponent to be weak — to have, say, only one pair, and 
you figure there's a 25 percent chance that opponent will fold 
instantly  if you raise. Now, although  a call has negative 
expectation, a semi-bluff raise becomes a profitable play. We'll 
work it out over 100 average hands, discounting any bets on the 
end. Your opponent will fold 25 times, and you steal $60 for a 
total of $1,500. He will call you 75 times, but one-fifth of those 
times you'll make the flush to beat him. Thus, 15 times you'll win 
$80 (the $60 in the pot plus your opponent's call of your $20 
raise) for a total of $1,200. The remaining 60 times you'll lose 
$40 (your $20 call and $20 raise) for a total loss of $2,400. After 
100 such plays, then, you figure to win $2,700 ($1,500 plus 
$1,200) and lose $2,400 for an average net profit of $300 and a 
mathematical expectation of $3 per play. The difference between 
calling incorrectly and raising correctly is a swing of $7 — from
136 Chapter Thirteen
a $4 loss per play to a $3 profit.4 What's more, if the bets you 
might win on the last round when you make the flush were 
included, your expectation would be even greater.
Summary
Some players are wary of raising, especially in situations like 
the one just described. However, raising should not be a rare play 
in your arsenal. Whether to get more money in the pot, to drive 
players out, to semi-bluff, or for any other reason, you should not 
hesitate to raise when strategic,  financial,  or  mathematical 
considerations demand it. Furthermore, raising may often be the 
best alternative to folding, while calling is altogether incorrect. A 
lot of average players find this concept hard to believe, yet as we 
have seen, it is indisputably true. It further emphasizes the adage 
that a caller in poker is a loser in poker.
4 Mathematically your semi-bluff raise would still be a 
profitable play as long as your opponent were to fold more than 
four times out of nineteen.
Chapter Fourteen  
Check-Raising
Check-raising and slowplaying are two ways of playing a 
strong hand weakly to trap your opponents and win more money 
from them. However, they are not identical. Check-raising is 
checking your hand with the intention of raising on the same 
round after an opponent bets. Slowplaying, which we discuss in 
more detail in the next chapter, is playing your hand in a way that 
gives your opponents no idea of its strength. It may be checking 
and then just calling an opponent who bets, or it may be calling a 
person who bets ahead of you. When you slowplay a hand, you 
are using deception to keep people in for a while in order to make 
your move in a later round. Clearly, then, a hand you slowplay has 
to be much stronger than a hand with which you check-raise. 
Check-raising can drive opponents out and may even win the pot 
right there, while slowplaying gives opponents either a free card 
or a relatively cheap card.
The Ethics of Check-Raising
There are some amateur poker players who find something 
reprehensible about check-raising. They find it devious and 
deceitful and consider people who use it to be less than well-bred. 
Well, check-raising is devious and it is deceitful, but being 
devious and deceitful is precisely what one wants to be in a poker 
game, as is implied by the Fundamental Theorem of Poker.
Checking with the intention of raising is one way to do that. 
In a sense, check-raising and slowplaying are the opposites of 
bluffing, in which you play a weak hand strongly. If check-raising 
and slowplaying were not permitted, the game of poker would 
lose just about as much as it would if bluffing and semi-bluffing
137
138 Chapter Fourteen
were not permitted. Indeed the two types of play complement one 
another, and a good player should be adept at both of them. The 
check-raise is a powerful weapon. It is simply another tool with 
which a poker player practices his art. Not allowing check-raising 
in your home game is something like not allowing, say, the hit and 
run in a baseball game or the option pass in a football game. 
Without it poker loses a significant portion of its strategy, which, 
apart from winning money, is what makes the game fun. I'm 
much more willing to congratulate an opponent for trapping me 
in a check-raise than for drawing out on me on a call he shouldn't 
have made in the first place — and if I am angry at anyone, it is 
at myself for falling into the trap.
Necessary Conditions 
for Check-Raising
Two conditions are needed to check-raise for value — that is, 
when you expect you might be called by a worse hand. First, you 
must think you have the best hand, but not such a great hand that 
a slowplay would be proper. Second, you must be quite sure 
someone behind you will bet if you check. Let's say on fourth 
street in seven-card stud someone bets with
you're getting sufficient pot odds to call. Now on fifth street you 
catch a king to make kings up. Here you might check-raise if you 
are pretty sure the player representing queens will bet.
This second condition — namely, that someone behind you 
will bet after you check — is very important. When you plan to 
check-raise, you should always keep in mind that you could be 
making a serious, double-edged mistake if you check and no one 
bets behind you. You are giving a free card to opponents who 
would have folded your bet, and in addition you are losing a bet 
from those who would have called. So you had better be very sure 
the check-raise will work before you try it.
Check-Raising and Position
When you plan to check-raise with several players still in the 
pot, you need to consider the position of the player you expect 
will bet because that position determines the kind of hand you 
check-raise with, to a large extent. Let's say you have made 
hidden kings up on fifth street, and the player representing queens 
is to your right. Kings up is a fairly good hand but not a great 
hand, and you'd like to get everybody out so they don't draw out 
on your two pair. You check, and when the player with queens 
bets, you raise. You are forcing everyone else in the hand to call 
a double bet, the original bet and your immediate raise, and they 
will almost certainly fold. You don't mind the queens calling your 
raise, for you're a big favorite over that player. However, if he 
folds, that's fine too.
Now we'll place the player representing queens to your left 
instead of to your right. In this case you should bet with kings up 
even though you know the player with queens will bet if you
Check Raising 139
showing, and with
140 Chapter Fourteen
check and even though you think you have the best hand. When 
you bet in this spot, you are hoping the queens will raise so that 
the double bet will drive out the other players in the pot, just as 
your check-raise was meant to do in the other instance. And if that 
opponent does raise, you can now reraise.
Suppose that instead of kings up, the king on fifth street gives 
you three kings. Now you are much stronger than you were with 
two pair, and your hand can tolerate callers. Therefore, you would 
use the opposite strategy you employed with kings up. With the 
probable bettor to your right, you should bet, and after everyone 
calls, you hope that bettor raises so that people will be calling a 
single bet twice (which they are much more likely to do than to 
call a double bet once).5 On the other hand, if the probable bettor 
is to your left, then you check the three kings, and after that player 
bets and everyone calls, you raise. Once again, you are inviting 
your opponents to call a single bet twice and not a double bet 
once.
In sum, the way you bet or check-raise depends on the 
strength of your hand in relation to what you can see of the other 
hands and the position of the player you expect to bet or raise 
behind you when you check or bet. With a fairly good hand, like 
kings up or aces up in seven stud, you try to make opponents call 
a double bet because you'd like to drive them out. With a very 
good hand like three kings or three aces you play to induce your 
opponents to call a single bet; then you confront them with having 
to call another single bet. In this case, you don't mind their 
staying in since you're a big favorite over them.
Check Raising 141
Check-Raising With a 
Second-Best Hand
While you generally check-raise because you think you have 
the  best  hand,  it  is frequently  correct to  check-raise with  a 
second-best hand if the play will drive other opponents out. The 
principle here is identical to the principle of raising with what you 
think is the second-best hand as it was explained in Chapter Nine 
and  Chapter Thirteen. If the probable  best hand  is  to  your 
immediate right, you can check, wait for that player to bet, then 
raise so that the rest of the table will fold rather than call a double 
bet. While you may not be the favorite, you have still increased 
your chances of winning the pot, and you have the extra equity of 
whatever dead money is in the pot from earlier betting rounds.
Sometimes you can check-raise with a come hand like a four-
flush if there are many people in the pot already and you don't 
expect a reraise, for you are getting good enough odds, especially 
if you have a couple of cards to come. This play should usually be 
made only when the probable bettor is to your immediate left; 
then the other players will call that bettor before they realize you 
are putting in a raise. You do not want to drive players out 
because you want to get the correct odds for your raise.
Summary
The factors you must consider when you plan to check-raise 
are:
1.The strength of your hand.
2.Whether someone behind you will bet after you check.
3.The position of the probable bettor.
5 This situation occurs when you only call the raiser. Often 
the better play is to reraise.
To check-raise with a hand with which you want to thin out 
the field, you want the probable bettor to your right so that people 
will have to call a double bet to stay in. With a very strong hand 
and with most come hands, you want the probable bettor to your
142 Chapter Fourteen
left so the other players in the hand might call that bettor's single 
bet and then be invited to call your raise.6
Chapter Fifteen  
Slowplaying
As we saw in the last chapter, check-raising is playing a hand 
weakly in order to raise later in the same round of betting. It is 
possible that you will win the pot right there when you check-
raise. At the very least, you will probably reduce the opposition 
to one or two players, which is what you usually want.
Slowplaying Versus 
Check-Raising
Slowplaying is not the same thing. It is playing a hand 
weakly on one round of betting in order to suck people in for later 
bets. Typical slowplays are to check if there has been no bet or 
just call a bet rather than raise. In other words, you take no action 
beyond what is necessary to stay in the pot. You give nothing 
away about the strength of your hand.
When you check-raise you usually want to reduce the number 
of your opponents, but when you slowplay you are trying to keep 
as many players in the pot as you can, expecting to collect later 
bets from them as a result of your early deception. Obviously, 
since you are not worried about having many players in the pot 
and are not particularly concerned about giving them free cards, 
you must have a very strong hand to slowplay — much stronger 
than a hand with which you would check-raise. In seven-card stud 
it might be three-of-a-kind on the first three cards or a flush or full 
house against one pair. In hold 'em it might be the top set of trips

206-208.

144 Chapter Fifteen
after the flop with no possible straight or flush draw showing. In 
draw lowball it might be something like a pat
Requirements for 
Slowplaying
In most cases, for a slowplay to be correct, all of the 
following must be true.
1.You must have a very strong hand.
2.The free card or cheap card you are allowing other players to
get must have  good  possibilities  of making  them  a
second-best hand.
3.That same free card must have little chance of making
someone a better hand than yours or even giving that person
a draw to a better hand than yours on the next round with
sufficient odds to justify a call.
4.You must be sure you will drive other players out by showing
aggression, but you have a good chance of winning a big pot
if you don't.
5.The pot must not yet be very large.
Point 1, having a strong hand, needs to be true for points 2 
and 3 to be true. Suppose in seven-card stud you have made a full 
house in five cards, and it looks as if your opponents are on flush 
draws and straight draws. When you slowplay and give them a 
free card, you would like all of them to make their hands so that 
you will get more action when you bet. At the same time, you are 
not worried that a free card will give them better hands than yours 
or draws to better hands with proper odds to chase. (However, you
Slowplaying 145
should not slowplay against these come hands if you think they 
would call when you bet.) In contrast, with three-of-a-kind in this 
situation, you should probably bet right out since there is a good 
chance a free card will allow one or more of your opponents to 
draw out on you when you don't make a full house.
Points 4 and 5 are also related. Opponents are much less 
likely to call a bet when the pot is small than when it is fairly 
large. As the pot gets larger, it becomes less and less likely that a 
slowplay is the correct play. The reason is that your opponents are 
getting larger and larger pot odds, and it is less and less likely that 
you could actually want them to get these odds. Therefore, when 
the pot becomes large, you are less inclined to slowplay because 
the odds you are giving opponents are so great that they can 
probably take them and not make much of a mistake, if any 
mistake at all. Furthermore, since opponents are unlikely to fold 
when the pot is large, it is not necessary to slowplay to keep them 
from folding.
Nor should you slowplay when you are showing obvious 
strength on board. Most players will know what you are doing, 
and they will not pay you off when you bet later. Players who 
don't know what you are doing, despite the strength of your 
board, will call an early bet anyway if they have any kind of hand.
When you are slowplaying, you are giving your opponents 
free cards or cheap cards. The Fundamental Theorem of Poker 
suggests such a play is incorrect unless your expectation is to 
show on a later round a larger profit than you would expect if you 
bet early. In other words, your deception has to have more implied 
value than what you would gain by betting immediately. At the 
same time, it is important that when your opponent calls on a later 
round, after getting a free or a cheap card, he is still not getting 
proper odds. Otherwise, it cannot be right to give him that free or 
cheap card, for you have given him the opportunity to develop a 
hand he is justified in playing even if it is not yet the best hand. 
Before slowplaying, then, you should make sure there is little 
chance you will be outdrawn. In seven stud and hold 'em games, 
you must be especially careful that you are not up against a
146 Chapter Fifteen
possible straight draw or a flush draw unless, as we noted earlier, 
you have a straight or a flush beat already.
Ironically, you would tend to slowplay with excellent hands 
but not with the pure nuts. With the pure nuts you should bet and 
raise immediately in case someone else has a strong hand too. 
Don't make the mistake made by a friend of mine who flopped a 
straight flush in hold 'em. He kept checking it on a slowplay only 
to find someone else was doing the same with an ace-high flush.
To elucidate this point further, let's take two situations from 
draw lowball. If the player to your right raises the blind, you 
should just call in middle position with a pat
Slowplaying 147
seven-card stud an obvious straight bets into your hidden ace-
king-high flush. You might just call if there are other flush 
draws around. But if you have only a king-high flush, you should 
raise to make it as costly as possible for higher flush draws to call 
and possibly draw out on you. Ideally a good slowplay occurs 
when, by making the hand they are hoping to make, opponents 
still end up second-best — i.e., when they are drawing dead. 
However, so long as your opponents will still not be getting 
proper odds after receiving a free card or a cheap card, a slowplay 
is worth considering.
You have a strong hand and hope other players will call the 
original raiser and stay around for the draw. At the same time, 
there is the slim possibility that the original raiser has you beat. 
However, with a pat bicycle — A,2,3,4,5 — you'd like to win 
some money from the first raiser. So you should reraise in the 
hope he has a monster and is happy to reraise you. The other 
players will probably fold, but you might beat the original raiser 
out of many bets before he discovers you have the pure nuts.
Summary
Slowplaying is an extremely effective way to get good value 
for your strong hands, but since you are giving weaker hands free 
or cheap cards, you must slowplay with caution. You must have 
a very strong hand. You shouldn't slowplay when your strength 
is obvious or when the pot is large. Nor should you slowplay 
when a cheap or free card has a fair chance of giving an opponent 
a better hand than yours or a justifiable draw. For example, in
Chapter Sixteen  
Loose and Tight Play
Loose poker players play a large percentage of hands. They 
have relatively low starting requirements, and they continue in the 
pot with relatively weak hands. Tight players play a small 
percentage of hands. Their starting requirements are high, and 
they are quick to throw away weak hands that don't develop into 
big hands. Some players always play loose. Others always play 
tight. Good players adjust their play to the game.
In Chapter Four we saw how the size of the ante relative to 
later bets is a primary consideration in deciding how loose or tight 
you should play. The higher the ante, the looser you play. The 
smaller the ante, the tighter you play. With a high ante, there is 
more money in the pot from the start; and the more money there 
is in the pot, the better pot odds you are getting to play hands that 
might not be worth playing were the ante very small. With a small 
ante, on the other hand, there's no point in gambling with 
marginal hands, especially when you know other players in the 
game are likely to be betting and calling only with big hands.
Which brings us to a second consideration in deciding how 
loose or tight to play — namely, the way in which the other 
players in the game play. Assuming a normal ante — about 10 
percent of the average future bets — it is commonly believed that 
when the players in the game play loose, you should play tight, 
and when the players in the game play tight, you should play 
loose. There is some truth to this principle. For example, you can 
steal antes with anything (a loose play) much more successfully 
against tight players, who will fold their marginal hands, than you 
can against loose players, who are likely to call you with those 
same hands. However, the principle of playing loose against tight 
players and tight against loose players is in need of refinement.
149
150 Chapter Sixteen
Loose Games
Semi-Bluffs in Loose Games
Remember that in a normal game, semi-bluffs have three 
ways of winning — by making the best hand later, by catching a 
scare card to make opponents fold later, or by making opponents 
fold immediately. It is these three possible ways of winning that 
make semi-bluffs profitable plays. But what is likely to happen in 
a loose game? First, loose players don't fold easily, so your 
semi-bluffs will rarely win immediately. Second, when you catch 
a scare card that doesn't really help your hand, loose players are 
more likely to want to "keep you honest" with a call than are 
average and tight players. Consequently, one of the ways a 
semi-bluff can win — when opponents fold immediately — has 
been all but completely eliminated; and a second way — when 
you catch scare cards — becomes doubtful. Without these two 
extra ways of winning, semi-bluffs no longer have positive 
expectation. Therefore, you must abandon most semi-bluffs when 
there's a high probability that the only way they can win is by 
improving to the best hand. With respect to semi-bluffing, then, 
it's true that you must play much tighter in a loose game.
Legitimate Hands in Loose Games
What about legitimate hands? In a loose game people are 
willing to play a hand that is relatively lower in value than the 
average. Therefore, your own legitimate hands don't need to be 
quite as good as in a normal game since your opponents are likely 
to be staying with you with even worse hands. This becomes 
especially true when you get heads-up against one opponent.
However, because of the action and the participants' style of 
play, loose games frequently tend to have multi-way pots. With 
many players staying in, you would be wrong to loosen up with 
hands like two small pair or one medium pair. Even though these
Loose and Tight Play 151
marginal hands might be favorites to hold up against each of 
several loose opponents individually, chances are they will lose 
when there are several opponents in the pot. By the same token, 
if you bet with these hands, you are much less likely to get two, 
three, or four opponents to fold, particularly when they are loose 
players, than you are to get one opponent to fold.7
Come Hands in Loose Games
In contrast to other semi-bluff hands and small pairs, come 
hands increase in value with many players in the pot because you 
are  usually  getting  excellent  pot  odds  to  draw  to  them. 
Furthermore, when the game is loose, you figure to get paid off 
well once you've made a straight or a flush. Therefore, in a loose 
game with several players in the pot, you should play more 
drawing hands, such as big three-flushes on fourth street in 
seven-card stud, than you would usually play.
In loose games, then, you should tighten up considerably on 
semi-bluffs but loosen up with legitimate hands. However, you 
would not play loose with marginal hands like two small pair or 
one medium pair when several opponents are in the pot.
Tight Games
In a tight game semi-bluffs increase in value, and even pure 
bluffs can be profitable since tight players are more likely to fold. 
Paradoxically, though, legitimate hands don't have nearly the 
value in a tight game that they would have in an average or loose 
game. The reason should be obvious. When you bet a legitimate 
hand for value in a tight game, you will be called only by players 
who have strong hands themselves because tight players' starting
The mathematical principle here is the same as the principle 
that governs bluffing against more than one opponent. See 
Chapter Eighteen.
152 Chapter Sixteen
requirements are higher. In a loose game an opponent with two 
small pair at the end will probably call your bet with aces up. But 
when you bet that same hand in a tight game — especially if both 
of your aces are showing — and you get called, you cannot feel 
too comfortable. The caller probably has you beat.
Many aggressive players fail to devaluate their legitimate 
hands when they sit down in a tight game. They steal money with 
bluffs and semi-bluffs, but when they get a decent hand, they wind 
up losing. Then they mumble to themselves, "If I just never got a 
hand, I'd be doing great because it's with my good hands that I 
lose." What they fail to realize is that in a tight game the value of 
a hand goes down because players who stay in the pot will have 
good hands themselves — better hands on average than players in 
a regular game would have.
In a tight game, then, you loosen up on bluffs and 
semi-bluffs, but you tighten up on your legitimate hands. Nor 
would you play as many drawing hands in a tight game, since 
you'd be getting pot odds sufficient to make it worthwhile less 
often, and when you did hit, you wouldn't get paid off as much as 
you would in an average or in a loose game.
Summary
Scrap the general notion that you play tight in a loose game 
and loose in a tight game and use the following guidelines instead. 
In a loose game you must tighten up on your bluffs and 
semi-bluffs, but loosen up on your legitimate hands. You bluff 
less, but you bet for value more. You also call with more hands 
and play more drawing hands. In a tight game you loosen up on 
your bluffs and semi-bluffs, but you must tighten up your 
legitimate hand requirements. You bluff more, but you bet for 
value less. You also call less and give up more quickly with 
drawing hands.
These guidelines can also be applied to individual players, as 
well as to games. When a very tight player with
raises in a small-ante seven stud game and everyone ahead of you 
folds, you would probably throw away a pair of jacks. You've 
tightened up your requirements because the chances are good your 
opponent already has you beat with a pair of kings. But when a 
very loose player raises in the same spot and everyone ahead of 
you folds, you might reraise with jacks, not as a semi-bluff but as 
a bet for value.
On the other hand, if you had
you might semi-bluff raise the very tight player who's betting a 
pair of kings since there's a decent chance that player will throw 
away the best hand, fearing you have aces. You wouldn't try that 
play against a very loose player, who is sure to call with kings.
To use all the poker tools at your disposal, you need to adjust 
your play according to the game and according to the individual 
players in the game.
Loose and Tight Play 153
Chapter Seventeen  
Position
A player's position in the betting sequence is an important, 
yet underrated aspect of poker. In our discussion of raising, check-
raising, and the free card, we have shown how position affects the 
way you play a hand. Indeed it can be said that position is one of 
the key elements affecting virtually every play in poker.
In games like five-card draw, draw lowball, and hold 'em, 
you know your position in advance of each deal since the person 
to the left of the dealer, the man under the gun as he's described, 
always acts first, and the dealer acts last. However, in stud games, 
both high and low, you can rarely be sure where you'll be in the 
betting sequence from one round to the next, as we have noted.
Position is more important in some games than in others; it 
is particularly critical in hold 'em and in five-card draw and draw 
lowball. However, in all poker games it is far better to be last to 
act, primarily because it is generally easier to decide what to do 
after you have seen what your opponents have done. Logically, 
then, the worst position is to be first since you must act before you 
know what any of your opponents are going to do. You might, for 
instance, have a hand that's worth a call if there are two or three 
other callers, but in first or early position you cannot be sure there 
will be any other callers. In last position you could know for sure 
whether you were getting favorable pot odds for a call, and if you 
weren't, you could save a bet and fold. When you are neither first 
nor last, the closer you are to last position the better, since you 
have fewer unknown quantities behind you and more relatively 
known quantities in front of you.
155
156 Chapter Seventeen
Advantages of Last Position
To suggest how important it is to be last, let's take a situation 
from seven-card razz. Suppose you started off with a good 
three-card low, and you think your opponent did, too. Now you 
catch a king or even a queen, and your opponent pairs up on 
board. Without a pair, you clearly have the best low hand if play 
were to stop immediately, yet you should not bet. The open pair 
makes it likely that your opponent will be last to act on every 
betting round, and that fact more than makes up for your slightly 
better first four cards.
Why is it so much better to be last? For a variety of reasons. 
If you are in last position with only a fair-to-good hand and the 
first player bets, you can call without having to fear a raise behind 
you. Players in early or middle position have no such comfort. If 
they call with a fair hand, they risk having to throw it away or pay 
a big price to continue when there's a raise behind them.
If you have a big hand in last position, your advantage is even 
greater. To see how much so, compare it to being first. In first 
position with a big hand, you might try to check-raise. But if no 
one bets behind you, you have lost a few bets from players who 
would have called a bet from you, while you have given a free 
card to players who wouldn't have called.
On the other hand, if you come right out betting in first 
position, you cost yourself money when a check-raise would have 
worked. Even in middle position with a big hand, you have 
difficult tactical decisions. If no one has yet bet and it's up to you, 
you must decide whether to bet or risk sandbagging. If someone 
has bet in front of you, you must decide whether it is more 
profitable and tactically correct to raise, inevitably driving out 
some players behind you, or to call in the hope of some overcalls 
behind you. In last position, you have no such problems. If no one 
has bet, you can, and if someone has bet ahead of you, you are at 
liberty to raise or to slowplay after knowing how many players are 
likely to remain in the pot.
Position 157
If your hand is mediocre, it is still advantageous to be last. 
On the first round you can call the small opening bet without fear 
of a raise. On later rounds players ahead of you may check better 
hands than yours, which allows you to check behind them and get 
a free card. However, if you checked that same mediocre hand in 
an early position, an opponent might bet a fair hand behind you, 
denying you a free card and probably forcing you to fold.
When  the  pot  is  down  to  two  players,  positional 
considerations still apply, perhaps more than when there are 
several players in the pot. In last position you can bet a big hand 
when your opponent doesn't and raise when he does. With the 
same hand in first position, you'd have to decide whether to try a 
check-raise or bet; when you check with the intention of raising 
and your opponent checks behind you, you cost yourself a bet; if 
you bet when a check-raise would have worked, you also cost 
yourself a bet.
With  a  mediocre  hand  against  one  player,  it's  also 
advantageous to be last. If you can't call a bet, you still may get 
a free card when your opponent checks. In first position, as we 
saw in Chapter Ten, you are not at liberty to give yourself a free 
card. Finally, if your hand is somewhere in the middle — good 
but not great — it is better to be last. It's true you will bet in either 
position, but in last position you have the edge of being able to 
call when your opponent bets. In first position you might bet what 
is a calling hand and find yourself raised by your opponent in last 
position.
The only real threat to a player in last position is the 
possibility of a check-raise. Consequently, in games where check-
raising is not allowed, being last is even more advantageous. Once 
players ahead of you have checked, you can feel reasonably 
confident they are not sandbagging with a big hand.
Advantages of First Position
However, this point does bring out the fact that there are a 
few situations where it's advantageous to be first. In first or early
158 Chapter Seventeen
position you get more check-raising opportunities. Furthermore, 
with a lock in first position you might win three bets by betting 
and reraising. Finally, you sometimes want to drive players out to 
make your hand stand up; only raising in early position, before 
opponents have had the opportunity to call the first bet, can 
succeed in doing this. Nevertheless, these first and early position 
advantages are minimal in comparison to the many advantages of 
being last.
Adjusting Play to Position
There are times when your positional advantage allows you 
to win a pot you would not otherwise have won. Most of the time, 
though, the best hand wins, whether it happens to be first or last. 
So what we really mean by positional advantage is the extra bets 
that may be saved or gained by your being in late position — a 
check after your opponent checks, a raise after your opponent 
bets, and so on. The importance of these extra bets cannot be 
overemphasized. Never forget that in poker we are trying to win 
money, not pots. Every decent player wins a fair share of pots, but 
it is the extra bets you can get into the pots you win and those you 
can save from the pots you lose that increase your hourly rate and 
the money won in the long run.
There is little you can do to secure last position from one deal 
to the next, but when you have it, you should make the most of it. 
In seven-card stud, for example, you should anticipate the position 
you will be in from one round to the next. If an ace or an open 
pair is to your immediate left, that figures to make you last in the 
next round. You may play your hand a little differently, a little 
more aggressively, a little more loosely, than you would if you 
were expecting to be first.
In contrast, when the bettor is to your immediate right, 
forcing you to act ahead of everyone else, you must tighten up 
considerably. It is extremely important that you fold almost all 
marginal hands in this position. The possibility of a raise behind 
you plus the chance of a reraise from the original bettor is
Position 159
devastating. Furthermore, you can frequently count on being in 
the same unpleasant position — not accidentally called under the 
gun — for the remainder of the hand. If you constantly call bets 
with marginal hands in this position, you will have to fold so 
many of them — either later in the same round when the bet is 
raised or on the next round when the bet is repeated — that you 
will lose an enormous amount relative to the occasional pots you 
might win by staying in.
Thus, in five-card draw, if a player to your immediate right 
in early position opens, you should throw away two aces in most 
cases. In the same position in lowball, you'd usually have to throw 
away a one-card draw to a 7,6 and possibly a 7,5, even though 
these are hands you'd gladly play if you were sure there would be 
no raises behind you. In seven-card stud if the player to your right 
raises  the  opener  on  third  street,  you  should  fold  most 
middle-sized pairs when there are several people behind you who 
might reraise.
With any of these hands you'd almost certainly call in last 
position, a  fact  that underlines another  of  that  position's 
advantages: You can play more hands. You no longer need to fear 
a raise from players who have not acted, and in most instances 
you will probably remain last on future betting rounds as well. 
Even in seven-card stud, when the bettor to your left happens not 
to be high on board and thus first to act, the other players will 
usually check around to that bettor on the following round.
Strong Hand, Bettor to the Left
Another significant advantage to last position is that when 
you make a strong handr you have more opportunity to win a big 
pot. You can sit there innocently with your monster hand and let 
the bettor to your left drive the other players around to you. That 
opponent bets, two or three players ahead of you call, and now 
bang, you raise. You get at least a single bet from opponents who 
told after you raise, and you get a double bet from those who call. 
You're also making it more expensive for them to try to draw out
160 Chapter Seventeen
on you when there are more cards to come. (Notice, in this 
situation, the problems faced by players in first and middle 
positions. Those callers in the middle always risk a raise from a 
player behind them.)
Strong Hand, Bettor to the Right
If you had the same strong hand but the bettor were to your 
right, you would not be able to play the hand in the same way. If 
you raised, you would be requiring players behind you to call a 
double bet to continue. Thus, you'd get fewer callers (if any) than 
you would if you raised in last position after they had committed 
themselves by calling the first bet. On the other hand, by just 
calling in first position, the best you can hope for is to collect 
some single bets from players behind you. At the same time, when 
there are more cards to come, you're making it relatively cheap 
for the callers to draw out on you. So with more cards to come, 
you have to decide whether your hand can stand competition or 
whether you should raise to drive players out.
How Position Affects Play
To show how differently you have to play in first and last 
positions, let's say I'm dealt
in no-limit hold 'em (where position remains fixed throughout the 
hand). If the opponent on my left raised a moderate amount and 
got three calls, I would also call as long as most of the players had 
a decent amount of money in front of them. Were I to flop three
Position 161
6s (the odds against it are about 8-to-l), I'd anticipate winning a 
big pot. However, were the player on my right to raise the same 
amount, I'd have to fold my pair of 6s even if I thought there 
would be some calls but no raises behind me.
My bad position is what makes the difference. It changes 
things enough on future rounds to turn a call into a fold. If I were 
to flop three 6s in last position, that 6 on board would look pretty 
innocuous. The original bettor would probably bet again, maybe 
get called, and then I could put in a big raise — or perhaps 
slowplay and wait to raise on fourth street. However, if the bettor 
were to my right, I couldn't immediately raise with three 6s and 
hope to be called by players behind me whether on the flop or on 
fourth street. Thus, when I'm directly behind the bettor, my 
implied odds are reduced so much that it's not worth calling that 
bettor's first raise before the flop.
Position Vis-A-Vis Other 
Players in the Game
Position is important in relation to the playing style of the 
other players in the game. You prefer having the loose, aggressive 
player in the game sitting to your right and the tight, conservative 
player to your left. Then you can usually decide how to play your 
hand after the aggressive player has acted, while you don't have 
to worry about many surprises from the conservative player 
behind you. You are also in a better position to control the 
aggressive player and indeed to trap him into mistakes. Similarly, 
if there are players in the game who tip off whether or not they are 
playing a hand, you'd like them to your left so you can use that 
information when deciding whether to call the first bet yourself.
Summary
In sum, while in a horse race you like being first, in a poker 
game you like being last.
Chapter Eighteen  
Bluffing
The 1978 no-limit hold 'em world championship at the 
Horseshoe in Las Vegas came down to a battle between owlish 
Bobby Baldwin of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and sartorial real-estate 
magnate Crandall Addington of San Antonio, Texas. An hour 
before the championship ended. Addington had $275,000, and 
Baldwin, about half as much — $145,000. Among the gamblers 
along the rail Addington was the clear favorite, but then came the 
hand that turned everything around. Acting first, Baldwin bet 
before the flop, and Addington called. The flop came:
Baldwin pushed in another $30,000 worth of chips, perhaps 
chasing a straight or a diamond flush. Then again he might have 
had a pair of queens. But Addington promptly called the $30,000. 
Obviously he had a good hand himself.
On fourth street the ace of diamonds fell — a scary-looking 
card — and by that time there was $92,000 in the pot. Slowly and 
deliberately Baldwin pushed in one $10,000 stack of chips, then 
another and another, until there were nine stacks in the center of 
the table. Finally, with something of a flourish, Baldwin placed a 
short stack of $5,000 on top of the others. He was making a 
$95,000 bet, leaving himself almost broke.
Addington deliberated for a long time. He glanced at the 
stack of chips, and then at Baldwin for some clue. Was the kid 
bluffing? If Addington called the bet and won, Baldwin would be
163
164 Chapter Eighteen
just about tapped out. If he called the bet and lost, Baldwin would 
take a commanding lead. Was the kid bluffing or not? Addington 
decided he wasn't and threw away his hand. As Baldwin raked in 
the $92,000 pot, he made sure to flash his two hole cards in 
Addington's direction. They were the:
Worthless. Baldwin had indeed been bluffing. Addington seemed 
to get rattled, and an hour later Baldwin won all the chips and 
became the 1978 poker champion of the world.
The Myth of Bluffing
Successful bluffs, particularly in a high-stakes game, have 
great drama. Furthermore, people who do not play much poker 
often think that bluffing is the central element of the game. When 
Stu Ungar appeared on the Merv Griffin Show the day after he 
won the 1980 world poker championship, the first question Griffin 
asked him was, "Did you bluff very much?" Many occasional 
players who visit Las Vegas are constantly bluffing in the small 
$ 1 -$3 and $ 1 -$4 games, and they pay dearly for their foolishness.
It's true bluffing is an important aspect of poker, but it is only 
one part of the game, certainly no more important than playing 
your legitimate hands correctly. Though a player who never bluffs 
cannot expect to win as much money as someone who bluffs with 
the proper frequency, most average players tend to bluff too 
much, particularly in limit games. When it costs an opponent only 
one more bet to see your hand, it is difficult to get away with a 
bluff, for with any kind of hand your opponent is usually getting 
sufficient pot odds to call your bet — especially if he has seen you 
trying to bluff several times already.
Bluffing 165
The Reality of Bluffing
With this proviso, it must be repeated that from a theoretical 
point of view, bluffing is an extremely important aspect of poker. 
As a deceptive weapon, it is at least as important as slowplaying. 
Whereas slowplaying suggests weakness when you have strength, 
bluffing announces strength when you are weak. Recollect the 
Fundamental Theorem of Poker: Any time an opponent plays his 
hand incorrectly based on what you have, you have gained; and 
any time he plays his hand correctly based on what you have, you 
have lost. An opponent who knows you never bluff is much less 
likely to play his hand incorrectly. Any time you bet, he will know 
you are betting for value. He will play only when he figures he 
has a better hand than yours or when he is getting sufficient pot 
odds to call with more cards to come. Bluffing, then, or the 
possibility that you might be bluffing, is another way of keeping 
your opponents guessing. Your occasional bluffs disguise not just 
the hands with which you are in fact bluffing but also your 
legitimate hands, with which your opponents know you might be 
bluffing.
To see how important bluffing is, imagine that you are up 
against an opponent who on the last round bets $20 into a $100 
pot. You are getting 6-to-1 from the pot if you call. However, you 
know you can only win, as is often the case, if your opponent is 
bluffing. Let's say you know three opponents well. The first never 
bluffs in this spot, so your response to that player's bet is easy: 
You fold with the full knowledge that you have not cost yourself 
any money. The second opponent frequently bluffs. Once again 
your response is easy: You call, knowing you are going to win 
that last bet so often that calling must result in a long-run profit. 
The third player is the problem. He bets in such a way that the 
odds are about 6-to-1 against his bluffing. In fact, he can tell you 
in advance that if he bets, he will be bluffing once in seven times.
Now you have a tough decision. You must choose between 
two equally upsetting alternatives. You are getting 6-to-1 from a 
Pot you can win only if your opponent is bluffing, and the odds
166 Chapter Eighteen
against your opponent's bluffing are 6-to-1. If you fold, you know 
there's a chance your opponent stole the pot from you; but if you 
call, you know that six times out of seven you are simply donating 
your money to your opponent. Thus, a person who bluffs with 
approximately the right frequency — and also, of course, in a 
random way — is a much better poker player and will win much 
more money in the long run than a person who virtually never 
bluffs or a person who bluffs too much. The person who never 
bluffs will never get much action. The person who always bluffs 
will get all the action he wants until he runs out of money. But the 
person who bluffs correctly keeps his true holdings disguised and 
is constantly forcing his opponents into tough decisions, some of 
which are bound to be wrong.
Optimum Bluffing Frequency
What is the right bluffing frequency? It is a frequency that 
makes it impossible for your opponents to know whether to call 
or fold. Mathematically, optimal bluffing strategy is to bluff in 
such a way that the chances against your bluffing are identical to 
the pot odds your opponent is getting. Thus, if, as in the example 
just given, an opponent is getting 6-to-1 from the pot, the chances 
against your bluffing should be 6-to-1. Then that opponent would 
break even on the last bet by calling every time and also by 
folding every time. If he called, he would lose $20 six times and 
win $120 once; if he folded, he would win nothing and lose 
nothing. Regardless of what your opponent does, you average 
winning  an  extra  $100  every  seven  hands.  However, 
mathematically optimal bluffing strategy isn't necessarily the best 
strategy. It is much better if you are able to judge when to try a 
bluff and when not to in order to show a bigger overall profit.
To make sure we agree on what is meant by a bluff, we will 
define it as a bet or a raise with a hand which you do not think is 
the best hand. Bluffing can be separated into a couple of different 
categories. There is bluffing when there are more cards to come 
and when there are no more cards to come. Secondly, within each
Bluffing 167
of these categories, there is intuitive bluffing, which is the subject 
of this chapter, and mathematical bluffing, which will be 
discussed in the next chapter.
Bluffs When There are 
More Cards to Come
When there are more cards to come, your bluffs should rarely 
be pure bluffs — that is to say, bets or raises that have little or no 
chance of winning if you are called, even taking into account the 
cards you may get on future rounds. Instead your early-round bets 
should be semi-bluffs, those powerful, deceptive plays we looked 
at in detail in Chapters Eleven and Twelve. It is important to bluff 
occasionally on early rounds to keep your opponents off-balance. 
But why do it when you have only one or two ways of winning? 
For a pure bluff to work, your opponent or opponents must 
generally fold immediately. However, as we saw in Chapter 
Eleven, a semi-bluff has three ways of winning. It may win 
because your opponent folds immediately, and it may also win 
either because you catch a scare card that causes your opponent 
to fold on a later round or because you make the best hand.
Nevertheless,  while  you  should  usually  restrict  your 
early-round bluffs to semi-bluffs, there is still nothing to prevent 
you from trying a pure bluff if you feel there's a good chance of 
getting away with it. If you think your chances of getting away 
with it are greater than the pot odds you are getting, then you 
should go ahead and try it. You may recall in the chapter on ante 
structure we mentioned playing in a game where certain players 
played too tight for the ante. There was $10 in antes, and if these 
players were the only ones in the pot, I knew I could bet $7 with 
absolutely nothing and have a good chance of stealing that $10. 
My pot odds in that instance were less than 11/2-to-l, but I knew 
I could get away with the bluff about 60 percent of the time. So it 
was a profitable play.
168 Chapter Eighteen
If you do make a pure bluff on an early round and someone 
raises you, don't try to tough it out. You've been caught. Since 
you have no out, you don't even have to think about continuing. 
Give it up, and get on with the next hand.
When you bluff with more cards to come, you often get 
called, and then you are faced with deciding whether or not to 
continue the bluff on the next round. Thus, when you bluff with 
a hand that probably can't improve to the best hand, you need to 
compare your chances of getting away with it to your effective 
odds if you are planning to continue betting on future rounds even 
when you don't improve.
For instance, if there is $100 in the pot in a $10-$20 game 
with two cards to come, you may have to bluff twice. If you think 
you will bluff twice, you are risking $40 to win $120 — the $100 
in the pot plus the $20 your opponent calls on the first round. So 
when you make that first $20 bet, you cannot think you are getting 
5-to-1 from the pot. Rather you are getting 3-to-1 ($120-to-$40). 
For the play to be profitable, there must be a better than 3-to-1 
chance your opponent will fold after the second bet. This is 
especially true of pure bluffs where you have no way of winning 
by improving to the best hand.
Deciding whether to continue with a semi-bluff really 
depends on how the next card affects your chances and how your 
opponent's card seems to have affected his. Each individual round 
should be evaluated separately. Suppose you make a semi-bluff 
raise in seven-card stud with:
You get called by a 9. Whether you should give up the bluff on 
the next round depends on what you catch, what your opponent 
catches, and also what kind of player your opponent is. If with
Bluffing 169
your A,K,5 you proceed to catch a queen suited with the king and 
your opponent catches a deuce, you ought to bet again; but if your 
opponent catches, let's say, an 8 suited with the 9 and you catch 
a 3, give it up. Check, and if your opponent bets, throw the hand 
away. Your chances have not improved, and it looks as if your 
opponent's have. He may have a flush draw, a straight draw, or 
simply a pair of 9s, but whatever he has, he looks like too much 
of a favorite for you to call when he bets.
It takes experience to know when to give up on a bluff and 
when to pursue it. When your first bet is called, presumably your 
opponent has something. If you sense he's getting stronger and 
you don't improve, give it up. If you sense he's weak and staying 
weak and if you think he thinks you're strong, continue the bluff 
and hope to drive him out.
Bluffs When All the 
Cards are Out
When all the cards are out, you obviously can no longer 
semi-bluff. You have either made your hand or you haven't. So all 
bluffs on the end are pure bluffs. They are bets or raises that you 
do not expect to win if you are called.
When you are sitting there knowing you have the worst hand, 
knowing you cannot win by checking, knowing you cannot win by 
calling your opponent's bet, the only question is whether or not to 
try to bluff. You should not if you think the chances your 
opponent will call are too great in relation to the pot odds you are 
getting. You should if you think your opponent will fold often 
enough for a bluff to show a profit. If there is $100 in the pot, you 
should make a $20 bluff if you think your opponent will fold more 
than once in six times. If there is $60 in the pot, you must assume 
your opponent will fold more than once in four times before you 
try to bluff. If there is $ 140 in the pot, your opponent needs to fold 
more than once in eight times. But, of course, the larger the pot,
170 Chapter Eighteen
the better pot odds your opponent is getting to call your bet and 
the more likely it is he will call with any kind of a fair hand.
Accurate assessment of your chances of pulling off a bluff 
comes, like so many advanced poker plays, only with experience. 
You must first be able to read hands. You are obviously not going 
to bluff out an opponent with a lock or any sort of big hand. In 
general, the weaker you think your opponent's hand is, the higher 
the chances your bluff will succeed.
Second, you must be able to read opponents. It's generally 
easier to bluff out a timid opponent than a loose opponent, and it's 
generally easier to bluff out a tough opponent than a weak one 
who looks for any reason to call, including the possibility that you 
might be bluffing. In essence, you must consider your specific 
opponent in each situation before deciding whether to try a bluff. 
Even the way in which play developed in previous hands can have 
a bearing on whether a bluff is now right or not.
Bluffing and Position
Your position can also affect the chances of a bluff's success. 
In most games with tough players, I've found it easier to bluff if 
I'm first than if I'm second and my opponent has checked. There 
are two reasons for this. If my opponent has checked to me, he 
knows he has shown weakness with his check, and when I bet, he 
suspects I am trying to take advantage of his weakness. So he's 
likely to call with any kind of hand. And, if he has a really bad 
hand, he might very well have tried to bluff himself. Since he 
checked instead, the chances are good he has a calling hand, and 
when I bet out on a bluff, he's likely to call, even if he thinks he's 
a small underdog. So in situations on the end where your hand 
can't win by checking but where you have reason to believe your 
opponent may be weak, a bluff in first position is more likely to 
succeed than a bluff in second position.
Bluffing 171
Bluffing Against Come Hands
Sometimes both you and your opponent have been drawing 
to a flush or a straight. You don't make your hand, but there's a 
good chance your opponent didn't make his either. Because of 
earlier bets on the come, there may be a fair amount in the pot — 
say, $ 100 in a $ 10-$20 game. Now let's say you are first, and you 
end up with an AJ high. You think there's a 55 percent chance 
your opponent made a legitimate hand, and there's a 15 percent 
chance he has you beat "by mistake" with something like an A,K 
or an A,Q high. In this spot you should bet because by betting you 
are likely to make your opponent throw away the A,K and A,Q 
high, thus improving your chances of winning from 30 percent to 
45 percent.
In contrast, when you have a busted hand and you suspect 
your opponent does, too, you may not want to bluff if you end up 
making something like a small pair. If you bet, your opponent will 
call with a legitimate hand, and he will fold without one. But if 
you check and then call, your opponent may bet his busted hands 
as well as his legitimate ones. Thus, with your small pair you beat 
his bluffs, which you could not do if you came out betting 
yourself. Either way, of course, you lose to his legitimate hands.
Bluffing Against Two or 
More Opponents
It is rarely correct to try to bluff out two or more people when 
all  the  cards  are  out;  your  chances  of  success  decrease 
geometrically with each additional player in the pot. Paradoxically 
you might have a profitable bluffing opportunity against each of 
two opponents individually, but not against both of them as a 
group. Suppose, for example, you are heads-up on the end in a 
$10-$20 game. There is $80 in the pot, and you think you can get 
away with a bluff one out of three times. Clearly this is an 
extremely profitable bluffing situation. Once you will win $80,
172 Chapter Eighteen
and twice you will lose $20 for a net profit of $40 or an average 
profit of $13.33 per bet.
Now suppose you are in the identical situation except that 
you are up against two players instead of one. We'll assume each 
player has put $40 in the pot to expand it to $120, and you think, 
as in the former case, that each opponent will fold one time out of 
three. You are now getting 6-to-1 instead of 4-to-1 from the pot. 
Nevertheless, an attempt at a bluff is no longer profitable because 
the probability that both of your opponents will fold is 1/3 X 1/3, 
which equals 1/9. In other words, eight times out of nine one or the 
other of your opponents will call on average. So you stand to lose 
$20 eight times for a total of $ 160 and to win $ 120 once. Your net 
loss is $40 or $4.44 per bet. Thus, opposing each individual player 
by himself results in a profitable bluffing situation, but if they're 
both in against you, you have gone from a profitable situation to 
an unprofitable one.
(It should be pointed out that in most bluffing situations 
against more than one player the probabilities that each player 
will fold are not independent. The player in the middle will 
frequently fold a hand that he would call with if he was last, and 
sometimes the player who is last will call with a hand he would 
have folded without hesitation had he been in the middle, 
expecting the player behind him to call. Nevertheless, the general 
principle still holds that it is usually more profitable to try to bluff 
one player out of a pot containing 2X dollars than to bluff two 
players out of a pot containing 3X dollars.)
Bluffing and Betting for Value
The  number  of  poker  hands  anyone  can  have  is 
comparatively limited, but in addition to the hands themselves 
there are so many other variables that rarely if ever is a particular 
play always right or always wrong. Your play is affected by the 
size of the pot, your position, the opponent or opponents you are 
facing, the way they have been playing, the amount of money they 
have and you have, the flow of the game, and other, more subtle
Bluffing 173
factors. This point is particularly applicable to questions of 
bluffing and betting fair hands for value on the end. Here are 
some general principles that usually apply.
When you bluff, you are rooting for your opponent to fold 
because that is the only way you can win the pot. When you bet 
for value, you are rooting for your opponent to call because you 
want your legitimate hand to win one more bet from him. It is 
important to realize that it may be right to bet a fair hand for 
value, and it may also be right to bluff, but it is almost never right 
to do neither. If you decide you can't get away with a bluff on the 
end when you miss your hand, then you should bet for value when 
you do make your hand. (The only exception to this principle 
would occur in games like hold 'em and five-card stud, where 
your opponent can see your last card and might often have a good 
sense of whether it made your hand. In those cases, if you bet a 
hand for value, you are likely to get called — or raised — only by 
a hand that has you beat.)
Similarly, when you don't think a value bet is justified with 
a fair hand, since your opponent will only call if he has you beat, 
then if you miss your hand, you should usually bluff. For when 
you bluff, it is possible your opponent will throw away his fair 
hands.
Sometimes it may be correct both to bluff and to bet a fair 
hand for value on the end. Suppose you are up against one player 
and decide, before you see your last card, that you will come out 
betting if you don't improve. In seven-card stud, let's say on sixth 
street you have:
Notice that in addition to your A,Q high four-flush you hold a 
small pair. When you pick up your last card, you find that you
174 Chapter Eighteen
didn't make the flush, but you don't have a bad hand either. You 
caught another queen and so now have queens up. Should you bet 
this hand for value?
Many professional players say no. They contend that if you 
were so sure you should bluff if you missed, then you should not 
bet a fair hand for value since you will only be called if your 
opponent has you beat. However, both plays may be right, 
especially if the pot is large. Let's say there's an 80 percent 
chance your queens up are the best hand, and there's a 30 percent 
chance your opponent will fold if you bet. That means that if you 
bet your queens up for value, 30 percent of the time your 
opponent will fold and not pay you off. Nevertheless, you are still 
a 5-to-2 favorite when that player calls your bet. You will win that 
extra bet 50 percent of the time, while you will lose it only the 20 
percent of the time your opponent has your queens up beat. 
Clearly, then, you should bet with your two pair since you have a 
5/7 chance of winning if you are called. On the other hand, if you 
miss making even two pair, there is still a 30 percent chance your 
opponent will fold what may be the best hand if you bet. 
Therefore, a bluff will also be profitable in the long run, so long 
as your bet is less than 3/7 of the pot.
A similar situation comes up in hold 'em when I am heads-up 
against a good player. I raise before the flop in last position, and 
my opponent calls. The flop comes something like:
My opponent checks. I check. He now suspects I have A,K; A,Q; 
or K,Q; and he is right. He is ready to call with any pair if a high 
card doesn't come, but if one does, he will consider folding. I 
know all this. Therefore, I am going to bet when an ace, king, or 
queen comes, even though only two of those cards pair me. My
Bluffing 175
opponent should call me often enough with the worst hand to 
make a value bet correct, yet I suspect he will fold with enough 
frequency to make a bluff profitable too.
Bluffing According to 
Your Opponent
You must, of course, consider your opponent when deciding 
whether to bet a fair hand for value or to bluff. Against a perpetual 
caller, obviously you should rarely bluff. However, against such 
a player you should bet any hand that you figure is a reasonable 
favorite to be the best hand. In contrast, against a tough player 
capable of tough folds, you can get away with bluffs more often, 
but you should be more reluctant to bet your fair hands for value. 
A tough opponent is not likely to pay you off with his worse 
hands, and when he does call, he's likely to show down a hand 
that beats you.
Here is a typical situation showing when a bluff is right and 
when it is not. Let's say in draw poker you draw three cards to a 
pair of jacks, and your opponent draws three to what you suspect 
is a pair of aces. First, we'll assume your opponent is the type of 
player who will almost always fold if his hand doesn't improve. 
In this instance, your play is to bluff if you don't improve since 
you may make your opponent throw away his pair of aces. 
However, if you make jacks up, you should check rather than bet 
for value since you are a big underdog if you bet and get called. 
If your opponent calls, he is likely to have made aces up.
Now let's assume your opponent is the type who almost 
never folds. Against this player you cannot bluff with one pair 
because he will almost certainly call you with his bigger pair. 
However, if you make jacks up against him, then you should bet 
for value since your two pair are almost a 5-to-2 favorite to be the 
best hand when you get called. The difference is that this 
opponent will call with one pair of aces as well as with aces up,
176 Chapter Eighteen
whereas the first opponent would most likely not have called with 
only a pair of aces.
Bluffing as Advertising
When you get caught bluffing, you of course lose. However, 
you may not mind being caught and losing early in a session 
because you are considering your image for future hands. You 
may even make an ill advised bluff early so that you will get a lot 
more calls on your legitimate hands the rest of the night. 
(Similarly, an early ill-advised call against tough players may 
keep them from bluffing against you the rest of the night because 
they fear you're likely to call their bluffs.)
Creating an image that you almost never bluff can also be 
advantageous. I am generally considered a tight player, and I 
sometimes pass up an early, marginally profitable bluffing 
situation to enhance this image. What that does is allow me to 
steal some pots in the future with complete impunity. No one 
imagines I am daring to bluff.
When you are up against even average players, they are 
constantly studying the way you play. So considering the effect of 
any play on future hands should be an important part of your 
game, especially in no-limit and pot-limit poker and especially 
when you are playing against the same people all night or from 
one night to the next or one week to the next.
Some players go so far as to argue that bluffs should show a 
loss because those losses will be repaid with interest when they 
get a lot of action on their legitimate hands. Game theory, as we 
shall see in the next chapter, suggests that when you employ 
optimal bluffing strategy, you should break even on your bluffs. 
However, there is no reason not to develop a sense of your 
opponents and of betting situations so your bluffs show a profit. 
A successful bluff wins the whole pot, and it takes a lot of extra 
calls of your legitimate hands to make up for one pot. Therefore, 
against all but very tight players, you should bluff slightly less 
than optimally so your bluffs show a profit. The greater your
Bluffing 177
reputation as a tight player, the more you will be able to get away 
with bluffs. At the same time, you will still get caught often 
enough to get paid off when you do have a good hand.
Summary
A bluff is a bet or raise with a hand you do not think is the 
best hand. With more cards to come, you should generally restrict 
yourself to semi-bluffs with hands that may become the best hand.
When deciding whether to make a pure bluff, you estimate 
whether your chances of getting away with it are better than the 
pot odds you are getting. However, if there are more cards to 
come and you plan to continue to bluff, you must take into 
account your effective odds.
On the end you should usually bluff with a busted hand when 
you think your opponent is weak. Against a tough player, the bluff 
tends to work more often in first position. However, if you have 
a hand with some value, don't bet when you are first so that you 
can snap off your opponent's bluffs. If you are in second position 
and your opponent checks, show down these same hands since 
they have little chance of winning if you bet and get called.
The  odds  against  a  bluffs  working  increase  almost 
geometrically with each extra person in a pot. Therefore, it is 
rarely correct to try to bluff out two or more players, especially on 
the end.
When to bluff and when to bet a fair hand for value is a 
difficult problem of judgment and experience. In general, if you 
do not think you could get away with a bluff, you should bet your 
fair hands for value; if a fair hand cannot be a profitable bet, then 
a bluff should be.
Bluffs are another tool of the well-rounded poker player. In 
my opinion, they should show a long-run profit the same as any 
other poker play. Even if you get caught only occasionally, you 
can still expect to get paid off when you do have a hand.
Chapter Nineteen  
Game Theory and Bluffing
Game theory sounds like a theory about games, but it is 
actually  a  branch  of  mathematics  dealing  with  the 
decision-making process. While it applies to games, as we shall 
see, it also applies to such disciplines as economics, international 
relations, social science, and military science. Essentially game 
theory attempts to discover mathematically the best strategies 
against someone also using the best strategies. Against an 
opponent you think is weaker than you are — and it can be in any 
game whatsoever — you would usually rely on your judgment 
rather than on game theory. However, against an opponent you 
think is better than you or against an opponent you don't know, 
game theory can sometimes enable you to overcome the other's 
judgmental edge.
To show how game theory can work in this regard, we'll 
employ the children's game of odds and evens. Each of two 
players puts out one or two fingers. If the total is even, one player 
wins; if the total is odd, his opponent wins. Now mathematically 
this is an absolutely even game. However, over a long series it is 
possible for one person to gain an edge by outwitting the other, by 
deciding whether to put out one or two fingers on the basis of 
what the other person put out in the previous round or rounds, by 
picking up patterns — in a word, by figuring out what his 
opponent is thinking and then putting out one or two fingers in 
order to foil him.8
Figuring out what the other person is thinking is, of course, 
a crucial aspect of poker. See Chapter Twenty-three, "The 
Psychology of Poker."
179
180 Chapter Nineteen
Suppose someone challenges you to this game. Feeling 
confident about his judgment and ability to outguess you, he is 
willing to lay you $101 to $100 per play. We'll assume you too 
feel your challenger has the best of it in terms of judgment. 
Nevertheless, by employing game theory, you can gladly accept 
the proposition with the assurance that you have the best of it. All 
you have to do is flip a coin to decide whether to put out one or 
two fingers.
If the coin comes up say, heads, you put out one finger; if it 
comes up tails, you put out two fingers. What has this procedure 
done? It has completely destroyed your opponent's ability to 
outguess you. The chances of your putting out one or two fingers 
are 50-50. The chances of a coin coming up heads or tails are 
50-50. However, instead of your thinking about whether to put out 
one or two fingers, the coin is making the decisions for you, and 
most importantly it is randomizing the decisions. Your opponent 
might be able to outguess you, but you are forcing him to outguess 
an inanimate object, which is impossible. One might as well try 
to guess whether a roulette ball is going to land on the red or the 
black.
Since your opponent is laying you $101 to $100, by using 
game theory you have assured yourself of an 0.5 percent 
mathematical advantage (or a 50-cent positive expectation per 
bet). You have removed whatever advantage your opponent might 
have had in out-thinking you and given yourself an insuperable 
edge over the long run. Only if you thought you could out think 
your opponent would you be better off using your judgment 
instead of a coin flip.
Using Game Theory to Bluff
In this chapter we are mainly concerned with how game 
theory can be applied to the art of bluffing and calling possible 
bluffs in poker. For this purpose we will talk about mixed 
strategy, a strategy in which you make a certain play — 
specifically a bluff or a call of a possible bluff— a predetermined
Game Theory and Bluffing 181
percentage of the time, but you introduce a random element so 
that your opponent cannot know when you are making the play 
and when you are not.
You will recall from the last chapter that, everything else 
being equal, the player who never bluffs and the player who bluffs 
too much are at a decided disadvantage against a player who 
bluffs correctly. To illustrate this point and to show how game 
theory can be used to decide correctly when to bluff, we'll set up 
a proposition.
We are playing draw lowball with no joker, and I give you a
pat:
You stand pat, and I must draw one card. If I catch a five, a six, a 
seven, an eight, or a nine, I beat you with a better low than yours. 
If I catch any other card, you win. That means that of the 42 cards 
remaining in the deck, I have 18 winners (4 fives, 4 sixes, 4 
sevens, 3 eights, and 3 nines) and 24 losers, which makes me a 
24-to-18 or 4-to-3 underdog. We each ante $100, but after the 
draw — which you do not see — I can bet $100.
Suppose I said I'm going to bet $ 100 every time. Clearly you 
would call every time because you would stand to win $200 the 
24 times I'm bluffing and lose $200 the 18 times I have the best
I take a:
182 Chapter Nineteen
hand for a net profit of $1,200. On the other hand, suppose I said 
I will never bluff; I will only bet when I have your 9,8 low beat. 
Then you would fold every time I bet, and once again you would 
win 24 times (when I don't bet) and lose 18 times (when I do) for 
a net profit of $600 since you win or lose $100 in each of these 
hands. So with either of these variations of the proposition, you 
definitely have the best of it.
However, if I only bluff some of the time, the situation is 
much different. Suppose I were to bluff only when I caught the 
king of spades. In other words, I would bet whenever I caught any 
of my 18 good cards and also when I caught the king of spades. If 
I bluffed this infrequently, your proper play would still be to fold 
when I bet because the odds against my bluffing are 18-to-l. But 
notice how this improves my position. Bluffing when I catch the 
king of spades still doesn't give me a profit, but it allows me to 
win 19 times instead of 18 and lose only 23 times instead of 24. 
That single bluff once out of 19 times has begun to close the gap 
between your status as a favorite and mine as an underdog. Notice 
too that you have no way of knowing when I am bluffing since I 
am randomizing my bluffs by using a card, an object as inanimate 
as the coin in the odds-evens game, to make my bluffing decision 
for me.
If bluffing with one card makes me less of an underdog than 
never bluffing at all, suppose I choose two — say, the king of 
spades and the jack of spades. Once again your correct play is to 
fold when I bet. But now you win only 22 times when I don't bet, 
and I win 20 times when I do. Assuming you have no way of 
knowing when I'm bluffing and when I'm not, my using just two 
key cards to bluff, in addition to my 18 good cards, has reduced 
you from 24-to-18 favorite to a 22-to-20 favorite — that is, from 
a 4-to-3 favorite to an 1 l-to-10 favorite.
This bluffing seems to have possibilities. Suppose instead of 
two cards, I picked five key cards — the king of spades and all 
four jacks. That means I would be betting 23 times — 18 times 
with the best hand and five times on a bluff. Now all of a sudden 
you are in a bad situation with your pat 9,8 because you have to
Game Theory and Bluffing 183
guess whether I'm bluffing when I bet. I could even tell you 
precisely the strategy I am using, but  you would still have to 
lose your money.
What would happen? You know there are 18 cards that will 
make me my hand and five other cards I will bluff with. Thus, the 
odds are 18-to-5 or 3.6-to-1 against my bluffing. With the $200 in 
antes and my $100 bet, the pot is $300. So you are getting 3-to-1 
odds from the pot. You cannot profitably call a 3.6-to-1 shot when 
you stand to win only 3-to-1 for your money. Lo and behold, by 
using five cards to bluff with, I win that pot from you 23 out of 42 
times, and you win it only 19 times. I make a profit of $400. Thus, 
my occasional random bluffing has swung a hand that is a 24-
to-18 underdog into a 23-to-19 favorite.
To assure yourself there is no arithmetical sleight of hand 
here, you can work out what happens if you call every time I bet. 
You will win $200 from me the five times I am bluffing and $ 100 
from me the 19 times I don't bet, for a total of $2,900. But you 
will lose $200 to me the 18 times I have the best hand for a total 
of $3,600. Your net loss when you call is $700, which is $300 
more than you lose if you simply fold when I bet.
Had I picked seven cards to bluff with instead of five, the 
odds would then be 18-to-7 against my bluffing, and since the pot 
odds you're getting are 3-to-1, you would be forced to call when 
I bet. However, you would still end up losing! Seven times, when 
I'm bluffing, you would win $200 from me for a total of $1,400 
and the 17 times I don't bet at all you would win $100 from me 
for a total of $1,700. Your wins after 42 hands would total $3,100. 
But I would win $200 from you the 18 times I bet with my good 
cards for a total of $3,600, giving me a net profit and you a net 
loss of $500 after 42 hands.
It should be pointed out — once again to make it clear there 
are no tricks to this arithmetic — that you would lose even more 
money if you folded every time I bet with my 18 good cards and 
seven bluffing cards. You would win $100 from me the 17 times 
I don't bet, while I would win $100 from you the 25 times I do. 
Your net loss would now be $800 instead of $500.
184 Chapter Nineteen
Optimum Bluffing Strategy
Let's say I choose specifically 6 key cards to bluff with. That 
means I will bet 24 times. 18 of those times I have the best hand, 
and 6 of those times I am bluffing. Therefore, the odds against my 
bluffing are exactly 3-to-1. The pot is $200, and when I bet, there 
is $300 in the pot. Thus, your pot odds are also 3-to-1. You are 
calling $ 100 to win $300. Now when the odds against my bluffing 
are identical to the odds you are getting from the pot, it makes 
absolutely no difference whether you call or fold. Furthermore, 
whatever you do, you will still lose exactly $600 after 42 hands. 
If you were to fold every time I bet, I would beat you out of $ 100 
24 times when I bet and lose $100 to you 18 times, when I don't 
bet, for a profit of $600. If you were to call me every time, you 
would beat me out of $200 six times when I'm bluffing and $ 100 
18 times, when I don't bet, for a total of $3,000; but I would beat 
you out of $200 18 times when I bet with my good hands for a 
total of $3,600. Once again my profit is $600. So other than being 
a psychic, there is no way in the world you can prevent me from 
winning that $600 per 42 hands, giving me a positive expectation 
of $14.29 per hand. Bluffing exactly 6 times out of 24 has turned 
a hand that was a 4-to-3 underdog when I didn't bluff at all into 
a 4-to-3 favorite — no matter what strategy you use against me.
We can now move to the heart of game theory and bluffing. 
Notice  first  that  the  percentage  of  bluffing  I  did  was 
predetermined — one time every 19 bets or 5 times every 23 bets 
or 7 times every 25 bets. Notice secondly that my bluffing was 
completely random; it was based on certain key cards I caught, 
which my opponent could never see. He could never know 
whether the card I drew was one of my 18 good cards or a bluff 
card. Finally, notice what happened when I bluffed with precisely 
six cards — which made the odds against my bluffing in this 
particular instance identical to the pot odds my opponent was 
getting. In this unique case my opponent stood to lose exactly the 
same amount by calling or folding.
Game Theory and Bluffing 185
This is optimum bluffing strategy — it makes no difference 
how your opponent plays. We can say, then, that if you come up 
with a bluffing strategy that makes your opponent do equally 
badly no matter how he plays, then you have an optimum strategy. 
And this optimum strategy is to bluff in such a way that the odds 
against your bluffing are identical to the odds your opponent is 
getting from the pot. In the situation we have been discussing, I 
had 18 good cards, and when I bet my $100, creating a $300 pot, 
my opponent was getting 3-to-1 odds from the pot. Therefore, my 
optimum strategy was to bluff with six additional cards, making 
the odds against my bluffing 3-to-1, identical to the pot odds my 
opponent was getting.
Let's say the pot was $500 instead of $200 before I bet. Once 
again I had 18 winning cards, and my opponent could only beat a 
bluff. The bet is $100, and so my opponent would be getting 
$600-to-$ 100 pot odds when he called. Now my optimum strategy 
would be to bluff with 3 cards. With 18 good cards and 3 bluffing 
cards, the odds against my bluffing would be 6-to-1, identical to 
the pot odds my opponent would be getting to call my bet. If the 
pot were $ 100 and I bet $ 100, I'd have to bluff with 9 cards when 
I had 18 good cards, making the odds against my bluffing 
identical to the 2-to-l odds my opponent would be getting from 
the pot.
It is important to realize that when the results are the same 
whether your opponent calls or folds, you will still average the 
same no matter how that opponent mixes up his calls and folds. 
Returning to the initial optimum strategy example, where I make 
a $100 bluff with 6 cards and bet 18 good cards into a $200 pot, 
I will still average $600 in profits per 42 hands in the long run 
whether my opponent calls 12 times and folds 12 times or calls 6 
times and folds 18 times, or whatever. The inability of a player to 
find any response to offset his disadvantage is the key to game 
theory problems, though most game theory books don't put it in 
this form.
Bluffing on the basis of game theory can also be described in 
terms of percentages. Suppose you have a 25 percent chance of
186 Chapter Nineteen
making your hand, the pot is $100, and the bet is $100. Thus, if 
you bet, your opponent is getting 2-to-l odds from the pot. Since 
there is a 25 percent chance of making your hand, there should be 
a 121/2 percent chance you are bluffing to create the 2-to-l odds 
against your bluffing, which is the optimum strategy. For 
example, in draw lowball there are 48 cards you do not see when 
you draw one card, and we'll assume 12 of them (25 percent) will 
make your hand. So you should pick 6 other cards (121/2 percent) 
out of the 48 to use for a bluff.
You pick cards, of course, to randomize your bets. Without 
the random factor, the good opponents against whom you use 
game theory to bluff would quickly pick up your pattern and 
destroy you. The beautiful thing about game theory is that even if 
your opponent knows you are using it, there is nothing he can do 
about it.
Game Theory and
Bluffing Frequency
According to Your Opponents
In actual poker situations, optimum strategy based on game 
theory is not always the best strategy. Obviously if you are up 
against an opponent who almost always calls you, then you 
shouldn't bluff at all. By the same token, if you are up against 
someone who folds too much, you should bluff with some 
frequency.
Game theory bears out these shifts in strategy. Notice in the 
first part of this chapter that if you bluffed with five cards instead 
of six — that is, slightly less than optimally — you would win 
$300 more per 42 hands if your opponent called rather than folded 
every time. However, if you bluffed with seven cards instead of 
six, you would win $300 more if your opponent folded rather than 
called every time. Here is where a player's judgment supersedes 
optimum game theory strategy: He would bluff a little less against
Game Theory and Bluffing 187
opponents who call too much and a little more against opponents 
who fold too much.
Good, intuitive players understand this concept. If they notice 
they have folded on the end a few hands in a row, they are ready 
to call next time. Otherwise players will start bluffing them. And 
they use similar considerations in deciding whether to bluff 
themselves. It is against such expert players, whose calling and 
folding are right on target, or whose judgment is as good as or 
better than yours, that game theory becomes the perfect tool. 
When you use it, there is no way they can outplay you.
Summary of Game Theory as a 
Tool for Bluffing
When using game theory to decide whether to bluff, you must 
first determine your chances of making your hand. You must then 
determine the odds your opponent is getting on that bet. Then you 
must randomly bluff in such a way that the odds against your 
bluffing are identical to your opponent's pot odds.
Here's one more example. Suppose you have a 20 percent 
chance of making your hand, there's $100 in the pot, and the bet 
is $25. Your opponent is then getting $125-to-$25 or 5-to-1 odds 
if you bet. The ratio of your good hands to your bluffs should, 
therefore, be 5-to-1. Since you have a 20 percent chance of 
making your hand, you should randomly bluff 4 percent of the 
time. (20 percent-to-4 percent equals 5-to-1.) When you bluff in 
this fashion, you take optimum advantage of the situation.
A good, convenient way to randomize your bluffs, as we have 
seen, is to pick cards from among those you haven't seen. If, for 
example, ten cards make your hand and you need a 5-to-1 bluffing 
ratio, then you should pick two additional cards to bluff with.
Here is another example. You draw one card to a spade flush 
in draw poker, and your opponent draws three cards. Therefore, 
the chances are enormous that your opponent will not be able to 
beat a flush, only a bluff. The pot contains $20. The bet is $10. If
188 Chapter Nineteen
you bet, your opponent is getting $30-to-$10 or 9-to-3 odds from 
the pot. Since nine unseen spades make your flush, you should 
pick three additional cards to bluff with, such as the two red 4s 
and the 4 of clubs. You now bet with twelve cards creating a 9-
to-3 ratio between your good hands and your bluffs.
It is not always possible to use cards to arrive at exactly the 
ratio you need to bluff optimally. However, as long as you are 
close, you can still expect to gain. You recall that choosing six 
cards to bluff with in the draw lowball example created exactly 
the right proportion vis-a-vis the pot odds my opponent was 
getting; nevertheless, I still ended up with a profit when I bluffed 
with five or with seven cards whether my opponent called or 
folded. Of course, the closer you are to the exact ratio, the better, 
in terms of game theory.
Using Game Theory 
to Call Possible Bluffs
Just as you can use game theory to bluff, you can also use it 
to call possible bluffs. Usually when your hand can beat only a 
bluff, you use your experience and judgment to determine the 
chances your opponent is bluffing. If your hand can beat some of 
your  opponent's  legitimate hands, then you do a standard 
comparison of your chances of having the best hand plus the 
chances your opponent is bluffing against the pot odds you are 
getting. However, against an opponent whose judgment is as good 
as or better than yours, or one who is capable of using game 
theory to bluff, you in your turn can use game theory to thwart 
that player or at least minimize his profits.
Suppose the pot is $ 100, and your opponent assumes you will 
fold one out of three times rather than call a $20 bet. It then 
becomes profitable for that opponent to come out bluffing $20 to 
win $ 100 because he figures to lose $20 twice but steal $ 100 once 
for a net profit of $60 and an expectation of $20 per bet. By the 
same token, if your opponent thinks you will never fold in this
Game Theory and Bluffing 189
situation, he will never bluff. Therefore, it behooves you to have 
an opponent think you might sometimes fold, but you should call 
sufficiently often to catch his bluffs.
When you use game theory to decide whether to call a 
possible bluff, you make calculations similar to those you make 
when deciding whether to employ a bluff yourself — and you 
randomize your calls just as you randomize your bluffs. You 
figure out what odds your opponent is getting on his possible 
bluff, and you make the ratio of your calls to your folds exactly 
the same as the ratio of the pot to your opponent's bet. If your 
opponent bets $20 to win $100, he is getting 5-to-1 on a bluff. 
Therefore, you make the odds 5-to-1 against your folding. That is, 
you must call five times and fold once. You can use key cards to 
randomize again — for example, if you catch certain unseen 
cards, you fold. Otherwise, you call.
In contrast to using game theory to bluff, using game theory 
to decide whether to call doesn't turn an unprofitable situation 
into a profitable one. All it does is prevent your opponent from 
outwitting you — just as using a coin in the odds-evens game 
prevents your opponent from outwitting you there. If your 
opponent is using optimum game theory strategy to bluff, there is 
still nothing you can do to get the best of him.
Summary
Game theory cannot replace sound judgment. It should only 
be used when you think your opponent's judgment is as good as 
or better than yours or when you simply don't know your 
opponent. Furthermore, game theory can be used accurately to 
bluff or call a possible bluff only in a situation where the bettor 
obviously either has the best hand or is bluffing — for example, 
a player in seven-card stud betting into your pair of aces with an 
obvious flush draw. However, if the bettor may be betting a 
legitimate hand that is not the best hand, then the concepts in 
Chapter Twenty-one, "Heads-Up On The End," would apply.
190 Chapter Nineteen
When using game theory to decide whether to bluff, you  must 
determine the pot odds your opponent is getting if you bet and 
then randomly bluff in such a way that the odds against your 
bluffing are identical to or almost identical to your opponent's pot 
odds. If your opponent is getting 5-to-1, the odds against your 
bluffing should be 5-to-1. By playing this way, you give your 
opponent no correct decision. He does just as well — or badly — 
in the long run by calling or folding.
When using game theory to decide whether to call a possible 
bluff— assuming your hand can beat only a bluff and assuming 
your judgment doesn't give you a hint — you must determine the 
odds your opponent is getting on a bluff. Make the ratio of your 
calls to your folds the same as those odds. If your opponent is 
getting 4-to-1 odds on a bluff, you must call randomly four out of 
five times to make that bluffing unprofitable.
Chapter Twenty  
Inducing and Stopping Bluffs
The two preceding chapters demonstrated how, with sound 
judgment or game theory, a player who bluffs correctly gains a 
tremendous edge over his opponents. In fact, given two games — 
one with otherwise poor players who bluff approximately 
correctly and another with solid players who do not bluff— you 
do better to play in the solid game. When I started playing draw 
poker for a living in Gardena, California, I intuitively suspected 
I was better off playing in games with the typically tight Gardena 
players than in the looser games with players who played too 
many hands. I realize now what the difference was. The tight 
players never bluffed, which was profitable for  me, whereas in the 
looser games players were bluffing more or less correctly — and 
that hurt me.
Good bluffing strategy is such a powerful weapon that it is 
important to develop tactics to keep your opponents from bluffing 
correctly. Naturally you are not concerned about changing the 
habits of opponents who almost never bluff or bluff far too much. 
But when you find yourself up against a player whose occasional 
bluffing keeps you on the defensive, you want to try to lead that 
opponent away from correct bluffing strategy. You want to induce 
him to bluff more than he should or stop him from bluffing as 
often as he should.
Whether you try to induce a bluff or to stop a bluff depends 
upon your opponent. If you are playing against a relatively tight 
player who nevertheless seems to be winning too many hands 
without getting called, suggesting he may be stealing some pots, 
you want to stop him from bluffing. That is, you want to push him 
away  from optimum bluffing strategy to the point where he is 
afraid to bluff you at all. On the other hand, you want to push an 
aggressive player who may be bluffing slightly more than
191
192 Chapter Twenty
optimally into bluffing even more. In other words, against an 
opponent who seems to bluff a little more than is correct, induce 
a bluff and make that player bluff more. Against an opponent who 
tends to bluff less than is correct, stop him and make him bluff 
even less. In either case, you are stopping bluffs or inducing bluffs 
to make your opponents bluff incorrectly.
Most professional players are aware of the power of correct 
bluffing strategy, so they often try to induce bluffs or stop bluffs. 
However, they sometimes forget an important principle: If you are 
trying to induce a player to bluff and that player bets, then you 
must call. This principle is obvious, yet many go against it. If you 
try to induce a bluff and still fold when your opponent bets, all 
you may have succeeded in doing is helping that player bluff you 
out of even more pots than he otherwise would have.
Similarly, if you do something to stop a bluff and then call 
when your opponent bets, you would do better and catch more 
bluffs if you didn't try to stop his bluffing in the first place. In 
other words, if you think your hand is worth a call after having 
tried to stop a bluff, it is crazy to have tried to stop the bluff. You 
simply reduce the possible hands your opponent might have bet 
with and therefore the number of hands he might have that you 
can beat when you call.
These two principles regarding inducing and stopping bluffs 
should be self-evident. When you try to induce a bluff, you will 
always call if your opponent bets. When you try to stop a bluff, 
you will always fold if your opponent bets. To do otherwise is 
completely counterproductive, and it would be better not to try to 
induce or stop a bluff in the first place.
Artificial Techniques
There are two basic kinds of techniques to induce and stop 
bluffs — strategic techniques and artificial techniques. Artificial 
techniques are easier to understand. They can be used only against 
average to slightly-above-average players, for they rarely work 
against tough opponents, who are likely to see through them fast.
Inducing and Stopping Bluffs 193
An obvious ploy to stop a bluff is to reach for your chips as 
though you're anxious to call. If your opponent still comes out 
betting, fully expecting you to call, you throw away your hand. Of 
course, you have to use this play against the right player. An 
experienced player who sees you reaching for chips and suspects 
what you are up to is all the more likely to come out bluffing, 
fully expecting you to fold.
A ploy to induce a bluff is to give the impression you intend 
to fold your hand. Now if your opponent bets, you call. But once 
again an experienced player who sees through the ploy might not 
bet without a good hand; realizing a bluff won't work, that player 
saves money when he or she has nothing.
There are several other artificial ploys — feigning disinterest 
in the hand to induce a bluff, feigning tremendous interest to stop 
a bluff — but they will not succeed often against top players. 
Against such players you must use strategic tactics.
Strategic Techniques
Stopping Bluffs
Essentially the strategy to stop bluffs is to represent more 
strength than you actually have. Your opponent will not try to 
bluff, thinking you have at least a calling hand and perhaps better.
Let's say you are playing draw poker, jacks or better to open, 
against someone you want to stop from bluffing. As the dealer in 
last position, you open with a pair of aces. After having originally 
checked in a very deep position, the potential bluffer now calls 
you. There is no chance that player has something like two pair, 
since in that case he would have opened himself. Instead he must 
be on the come. Drawing first, he takes one card, which either 
makes his hand or doesn't. Now you stand pat! Even when you 
check after the draw, your opponent will almost never bet unless 
he actually made his hand. He certainly will not try a bluff in the 
hope that you will throw away a pat hand. He probably won't
194 Chapter Twenty
even bet a small straight. If he does bet, he's made his hand, and 
you fold, knowing you have not cost yourself any money — that 
is, knowing your opponent did not steal the pot from you.
To stop a bluff in this spot, some players would draw one 
card, representing two pair, and many players would draw two, 
representing three-of-a-kind. But in either case, their opponent 
may still bluff, and he will probably be bluffing approximately 
correctly. By standing pat, you are stopping the bluff almost 
completely at almost no cost to yourself. Since you have two aces, 
there is no chance your opponent can catch a bigger pair than 
yours, and the odds are approximately 500-to-l that you would 
make a full house by drawing three cards at the same time that 
your opponent makes a straight or flush.
By stopping a bluff in this fashion, you have reduced your 
opponent's chances of winning money from you to a minimum. 
Let's assume the opponent who draws one card makes the hand 20 
percent of the time. When that opponent never bluffs — and by 
standing pat you have pretty well forced him not to bluff— you 
win the pot 80 percent of the time. Given the pot's size, your 
opponent's proper bluffing frequency, according to game theory, 
is about 7 percent. However, as long as your opponent bluffs 
anywhere from 1 percent to 20 percent of the time, he does better 
than if he doesn't bluff at all. If, for instance, he bluffs only 2 
percent of the time, you still shouldn't call when he bets, and now 
he wins 22 percent of the pots rather than 20 percent. If he bluffs 
10 percent of the time, he is still a 2-to-l favorite to have his hand 
made when he bets. Since the pot is giving you better than 3-to-1 
odds with the antes, you are forced to call, but you will lose that 
last bet two times out of three. So you clearly fare better when this 
opponent never bluffs (or, of course, bluffs way too much) than 
when he bluffs anywhere near correctly.
Inducing and Stopping Bluffs 195
Suppose you are up against an opponent who usually bluffs 
correctly in hold 'em, and the following hand develops:
Opponent
Your opponent is first to act and he bets. You are worried 
about a flush or a straight, as well as other hands, but you are also 
worried about a possible bluff. Therefore, after he bets, you 
should raise with your two small pair. If he calls with, say, a pair 
of kings or a four-flush, he will certainly not try to bluff you out 
on the end. On the other hand, if he reraises or calls and then bets 
on the end, you should usually throw your hand away. You know 
you are beat since your opponent would be afraid to bluff you 
after you have suggested so much strength.

Inducing and Stopping Bluffs 197
Inducing Bluffs
When you are up against a player who bluffs too much, rather 
than stop his bluffs, you should usually induce one. Let's take an 
example similar to the draw poker example earlier. Once again as 
the dealer you open with two aces or even two queens, and an 
aggressive player who originally checked now calls. This player 
takes one card, and you're sure he's on the come. Since you want 
this player to bluff, you should go out of your way to take three 
cards, making it clear you're starting off with only one pair. Now 
if he bets, you call. Even if you've succeeded in increasing the 
player's tendency to bluff only slightly, you have gained by 
inducing a bluff. You have given yourself more winning chances 
when you call that last bet than you would have otherwise had.
Just as you try to stop a bluff by representing strength, you 
try to induce a bluff by representing weakness. Let's say you have 
a high pair in the hole in hold 'em, and on fourth street the board 
is something like:
You should check behind an opponent who checks if you want to 
induce him to bluff on the end. The only dangerous thing about 
this play is that you are giving your opponent a free card. If he has 
an ace, any ace on the end gives him the best hand. However, if 
he has a small pair, the odds are a long 21-to-l that he will 
improve to three-of-a-kind. Of course,  if your opponent is 
slowplaying three 9s, you are already beat, and you save a bet. 
The question you must ask yourself is whether you want to bet on 
fourth street to avoid giving a free card or whether it's worth 
trying to induce a bluff on the end.
Opponent
You have the best possible first four cards. Yet you should 
frequently check and call if your opponent bets. Besides 
disguising your hand, you are inducing a bluff on a future betting 
round.
When you are inducing opponents to bluff, it isn't necessary 
to lure them so far away from correct bluffing strategy that they 
are favorites to be bluffing when they bet. All you want to do is 
lead them to bluff significantly more than the correct frequency. 
Clearly you should never stop bluffs by people who bluff way too 
much. However, it may be correct to induce bluffs from people 
who rarely bluff if you can induce them to bluff more often than 
their chances of making the hand.
Summary
Players who bluff with approximately the correct frequency 
are dangerous opponents because they often force you into 
the

slowplaying. Take this hand from seven-card razz:
You

position of making an incorrect play. Therefore, it is important to 
try to stop or induce bluffs to lead opponents away from correct 
bluffing strategy.
You should normally induce a bluff against players who 
already bluff too much and stop bluffs against players who 
already bluff too little.
In the first case, you are in a situation where you would have 
to call if your opponent bets. By inducing a bluff, you increase 
your chances of winning that last bet since your opponent will bet 
more hands — including his bluffs — that you can beat than he 
otherwise would.
In the second case, against someone who bluffs too little, you 
feel you would have to fold if that opponent bets, even though 
there is some chance he might be bluffing. By stopping his bluffs, 
you reduce the opponent's chances of winning since he will bet 
only when he has made his hand, and you can comfortably fold.
Besides artificial means, you try to induce a bluff by showing 
weakness on an earlier round; you stop a bluff by showing 
strength on an earlier round. Thus, inducing a bluff is something 
akin to slowplaying, and stopping a bluff is something akin to 
semi-bluffing.
When you induce a bluff, you plan to call if your opponent 
bets since you have increased the chances he is bluffing. When 
you stop a bluff, you plan to fold if your opponent bets since you 
have reduced or even completely eliminated the chances he is 
bluffing.
Chapter Twenty-one  
Heads-Up On The End
Most of the concepts we have discussed up to now apply to 
situations in which there are more cards to come and in which 
there may be more than two players in the pot. However, if the 
war that is a poker hand continues from the struggle for the antes 
to the final showdown, it eventually reaches a last round of 
betting, most often between two players. And in this last round, 
after all the cards are out, you must sometimes apply concepts 
totally different from those that were operative in earlier betting 
rounds. In this chapter we will discuss these concepts. They apply 
to any one-winner limit game (thus excluding high-low split) 
when two players are heads-up on the end.
Bluffing On The End
There are two basic conditions that determine how you act 
when you are heads-up on the end — whether or not you have 
made a legitimate hand and whether you are in first position or 
last position. Without a legitimate hand against an opponent with 
a legitimate hand, you cannot win except on a bluff— a bet or a 
raise that causes your opponent to fold. You cannot hope to win 
by checking or by calling. Determining whether or not to try a 
bluff on the end is based on the same logic as any other bet. You 
have to decide whether the attempt has positive expectation. If the 
pot is $100 and you bet $20 with nothing, you have to believe 
your opponent will fold more than once in six times in order to 
expect a profit. Thus, if your opponent folds once in five times, 
you will lose $20 four times, but you will win $100 once on 
average for a net profit of $20 or an average profit of $4 per hand. 
However, if your opponent folds once in seven times, you will
199
200 Chapter Twenty-one
lose $20 six times and win $100 once for a net loss of $20 or an 
average loss of $2.86 per hand. Whether a bluff works often 
enough to be profitable depends, like most plays on the end, upon 
an accurate assessment of what your opponent is likely to do.
While it's tough to get away with a bluff on the end, it's 
much tougher to get away with a bluff raise. Your opponent needs 
to fold more often for a bluff raise to show a profit because you 
are putting in a double bet. Suppose, as in the last case, there is 
$100 in the pot, and your opponent bets $20. You now call his $20 
and raise another $20 on a bluff. With your opponent's $20 bet, 
the pot has increased to $120, but you are making a $40 
investment in the hope your opponent will fold. Since you are 
now getting only 3-to-1 for your money, your opponent must no 
longer fold more than once in six times but more than once in four 
times for you to show a profit. Yet when calling your bluff raise, 
your opponent is getting 8-to-l for his money. The $100 already 
in the pot, plus your opponent's original $20 bet, plus your $40 
call and raise adds up to a total of $160 in exchange for the 
opponent's $20. So as we noted in the chapter on raising, it takes 
a very tough opponent, capable of super-tough folds, to throw 
away a legitimate hand in this situation. Average players will 
almost always call. The only time a bluff raise might work against 
them is when you suspect correctly that they have nothing 
themselves. Most of the time, though, when your opponent bets 
and you have nothing, your best play is to fold.
Let us now consider betting strategy heads-up on the end 
when you have a legitimate hand. You are going to be either first 
or last to act, and as we have noted, strategy changes according to 
your position. We'll begin by looking at strategy in last position, 
which is not quite so tricky as in first position.
Heads-Up On The End 201
Last Position Play
Last Position Play After Your 
Opponent Has Checked
When you are in last position, your opponent will have either 
checked or bet. First, what should you do when your opponent 
checks? Some might reply that you should bet if you think you 
have the best hand. But this is not at all the case. Your chances of 
having the best hand might be as high as 90 percent or better, but 
still you should not necessarily bet. Take the following hand from 
seven-card stud:9
Opponent
With four jacks your chances of having the best hand are 
enormous, but in either first or second position you cannot

becouse it illustrates the principle so succinctly.
You
202 Chapter Twenty-one
possibly bet the hand on the end for the simple reason that your 
bet has absolutely no positive expectation. Since your four jacks 
are exposed for the world to see, your opponent will fold every 
hand he can have except four queens or a straight flush in hearts. 
With either of those hands, he will raise. So your bet has nothing 
to gain and everything to lose.
This very obvious situation points toward the key distinction 
between play in the final round of betting and in earlier rounds. 
With one card to come, you would most certainly bet the four 
jacks to avoid giving your opponent a free card to outdraw you. 
Your bet forces him either to fold and thus give up any chance to 
outdraw you or to call and pay for that slim chance. However, 
when all the cards are out, betting to avoid giving a free card no 
longer applies. So if you now still decide to bet your hand, you no 
longer ask what your chances are of having the best hand but 
rather what the chances are of winning the last bet when you are 
called.
This distinction may seem like hair-splitting, but it is most 
assuredly not. In fact, it is crucial to successful play — that is, to 
winning or saving extra bets — when you are heads-up on the 
end. To take a very common situation, let's say you have three-
of-a-kind in seven-card stud, and you know your opponent  is 
drawing to a flush and has nothing else. The odds against that 
opponent's making the flush on the last card are, we'll assume, 4-
to-1, which means you are an 80 percent favorite to have the best 
hand. However, if your opponent checks, you certainly should not 
bet because, as in the case of the four open jacks, a bet has no 
positive expectation. Your opponent will fold if he didn't make 
the flush, and he will call or possibly raise if he did. So even 
though you are an 80 percent favorite to have the best hand, you 
become an underdog if you bet and get called. To repeat, then, the 
decision to bet a legitimate hand for value on the end should be 
based not on your chances of having the best hand but on your 
chances of winning the last bet when you are called.
When you bet for value on the end after your opponent has 
checked, you must figure your hand has better than a 50-50
Heads-Up On The End 203
chance of winning when you are called. In fact, you have to figure 
it has at least about a 55 percent chance of winning to compensate 
for those times when your opponent is planning to check-raise. 
With three-of-a-kind against a flush draw, you are certainly the 
favorite, but you are not the favorite if your opponent calls. Yet to 
show a profit on your last round bets, clearly you must be the 
favorite even when your opponent calls.
At the same time, you should not carry this principle to such 
an extreme that you bet only when you have a lock, because then 
you will not win a lot of final bets you should win. To bet on the 
end after your opponent has checked, it is only necessary that you 
are the favorite when your opponent calls. Thus, if you figure you 
are only a 60 percent favorite when called, you should certainly 
bet even though you know there's a 40 percent chance your 
opponent will beat you if he calls. Your bet still has positive 
expectation. After ten such bets you will have won six and lost 
four on average for a net profit of two bets. Even if one of those 
four losses is a check-raise which you call, you still win six bets 
while losing five for a one-bet profit.
To give a concrete example of such relatively close decisions, 
let's say you are playing draw poker, and your opponent stands 
pat and then checks to you when you draw one. Since your 
opponent stood pat, you are quite sure you are facing a straight, a 
flush, or a full house. Yet your opponent checked to you. You 
know he will call with just about any of his hands. Therefore, you 
should bet an ace-high straight or even a queen-high straight, 
because your opponent probably would have come out betting 
himself with a tiny flush or better. Chances are, then, he has a 
straight smaller than yours. It's true you may lose in the 
showdown, but you are enough of a favorite with a queen-high 
straight to warrant a bet.
204 Chapter Twenty-one
Last Position Play After 
Your Opponent Has Bet
Let us now consider your options in last position when your 
opponent does not give you a free call but comes out betting. 
When he bets, you can either fold, call, or raise.
Deciding whether to fold or call is relatively straightforward. 
The question is: Are your chances of winning the pot better than 
the odds you are getting from the pot, either because your hand is 
better than your opponent's or because your opponent is bluffing? 
If you think your chances are better, you call. If not, you fold.
If you are thinking of raising after your opponent bets, you 
must ask the same question you would have asked before betting 
had your opponent checked: What are the chances of winning that 
extra bet when you are called? You should not raise unless you 
figure you are at least a 55 percent favorite, since you also face 
the possibility of a reraise. In fact, one way of looking at raising 
an opponent on the end without the nuts is that you are laying 
almost 2-to-l odds on that last bet, especially if your opponent is 
capable of bluffing on a reraise. When you raise and your 
opponent raises back, you usually lose two bets, but if he calls, 
you only gain one bet. Of course, this consideration does not 
apply against a player who will never bluff on a reraise. If such a 
player raises you back, you can just throw your hand away, 
knowing you are beat.
Before raising on the end, you must also consider the overall 
ability of your opponent. Once he puts in an initial bet, an average 
player will call your raise almost every time. Therefore, you 
certainly should not try a bluff raise. However, you should raise 
with any hand you consider a reasonable favorite to win the last 
bet because you can be pretty sure of getting paid off. Tough 
players, on the other hand, will frequently come out betting, but 
they are capable of folding and not paying you off if you raise. 
Therefore, a bluff raise has some chance against them. However, 
when you are raising for value against tough players, you should
Heads-Up On The End 205
have a better hand than you need against average players, because 
when the former are willing to call your raise and thus pay you 
off, they are likely to show down a strong hand. On close 
decisions you should not raise tough players on the end as often 
as you would weak or average players because you don't win that 
extra bet often enough to make the play profitable. Tough players 
either throw away a hand you would beat or call with a hand you 
might not be able to beat.
Ironically, though, a raise may sometimes be correct against 
a world-class player when you have a hand that is only fairly 
good. The key factor is whether a raise will make your opponent 
throw away some hands that are better  than yours. Let's say you 
have a hand that you figure has a 52 percent chance of winning if 
you call, but little chance of winning if you raise and get called. 
Nevertheless, it would be correct to raise if you think your 
opponent will then throw away some hands that beat you. If your 
analysis is correct, a raise might lift you from a 52 percent 
favorite to a 65-70 percent favorite, and if the pot is big enough, 
that added 13-18 percent gives the raise positive expectation. 
Remember, though, that this play is worth considering only 
against superstars. Against average and good players — and also 
against superstars most of the time — the basic formula for 
raising on the end remains the same: Raise only if you are favored 
to win that extra bet when your opponent calls.
To summarize play in last position after your opponent has 
bet, you have three options — fold, call, or raise. You should 
generally fold when the chances of winning are less than the pot 
odds you are getting. Thus, if your hand has only a 15 percent 
chance of winning and the pot is $80, you cannot call a $20 bet. 
However, your chances of winning do not have to be over 50 
Percent to justify a call. All that's necessary is that the pot odds 
you're getting are better than your chances of winning in the 
showdown. Thus, if you think you have a 30 percent chance and
the pot is $80,you would be right to call a $20 bet because the pot
o
dds you're getting are greater than the odds against your showing
down the best hand. Even when you decide you can or cannot 
call
206 Chapter Twenty-one
with your underdog hand, you have not necessarily eliminated the 
option of raising. Against a very, very good player, you might 
consider raising with some mediocre hands if a raise has greater 
expectation than a fold or a call — that is, if it will make your 
opponent throw away enough hands that would be better than 
yours. Anytime you are last and your opponent bets, you always 
have the three alternatives of folding, calling, or raising. The one 
that becomes right is the one that gives you the highest 
mathematical expectation.
First Position Play
When you are first to act with a legitimate hand, you have 
four options. One is to check with the intention of raising if your 
opponent bets. Another is to come out betting. The third is to 
check with the intention of calling if your opponent bets. And the 
fourth is to check and fold if your opponent bets.
Check-Raising in First Position
With very strong hands your options are to try a check-raise 
or to come out betting. The key factors in deciding whether to 
check-raise are:
1.The chances your opponent will bet if you check.
2.The chances your opponent will call your raise.
The second factor is just as important as the first, because if there 
were no chance your opponent would call your raise, it would 
usually be wrong to check since you'd risk not winning even a 
single bet when your opponent checks behind you. However, all 
but very tough players will generally call your raise after you have 
checked and they have put in an initial bet. They might grumble 
as they do it, but they'll do it.
In limit games the decision to check-raise or come out betting 
can be determined by a precise formula. To simplify, we'll
Heads-Up On The End 207
assume you know for sure you have the best hand. First, 
determine what percentage of times your opponent will call if you 
bet. That's one side of the equation. Next determine what 
percentage of times your opponent will bet if you check but then 
fold when you raise. Finally, determine what percentage of times 
your opponent will bet if you check and then call your raise. Now 
double this last percentage. If the sum of the last two percentages 
is greater than the first, it is correct to try a check-raise.
This formula may sound overly complicated, but it really is 
not. Let's say you think there is a 70 percent chance your 
opponent will call if you bet. But you also think there is a 40 
percent chance he will bet if you check and call your raise, thus 
rewarding you with a double bet; and perhaps there's another 10 
percent chance he'll bet if you check but fold when you raise. 
Because you'll win two bets 40 percent of the times that you 
check, you double that figure to 80 and add the remaining 10 
percent chance your opponent will bet and fold when you raise. 
That adds up to 90, and since 90 is greater than the 70 percent 
chance that your opponent will call your bet, it is right to check-
raise.
Another way of looking at the problem is in terms of 
expectation. Let's say you bet 100 times, and you check with the 
intention of raising 100 times. In the former case, you'll win 70 
bets; in the latter you'll win 80 bets when your opponent bets and 
calls your raise and 10 more when he bets and folds, for a total of 
0 bets. You win 20 bets more by check-raising, and so check-
raising has greater expectation than betting out.
Most players do not check-raise enough on the end. They'd 
rather go for the single bet in the hopes of getting called. 
However, it is worth taking a little chance of losing one bet if 
there is a good chance of gaining two bets. Since most players 
will automatically call a rais,e when you check-raise, you can 
simplify the above formula. In general, you should check with the 
intention of raising if you believe the chances of your opponent's
betting when you check are at least half as good as the chance of
hi
s calling when you bet. Nor should you get discouraged if you
208 Chapter Twenty-one
occasionally check and your opponent checks behind you. Check-
raising is a long-run gamble like everything else in poker. If you 
know you should win two bets in a particular situation more than 
half as often as you would win one bet, then you made the right 
play by checking even if it didn't happen to work. Sometimes you 
also gain an added benefit when a check-raise doesn't work. Since 
your opponents noticed you checked a good hand once, they may 
become a little timid about betting behind you on future hands, 
thus saving you some bets on second-best hands with which you 
were planning to call if they bet.
Check-raising on the end works best against average-to-good 
players. You should try it less often against weak players and 
tough players. Weak players tend to call so much on the end when 
you bet that you have to be pretty certain they will bet for a 
check-raise to be profitable. If, for example, you are sure your 
opponent will call if you come out betting, you have to be over 50 
percent sure he will bet if you check before you consider check-
raising. Even 50 percent isn't good enough unless you are also 
sure your opponent will call when you raise (which, of course, a 
weak player will most likely do).
Against tough players you would check-raise less often 
because tough players tend not to bet as many hands on the end as 
they call you with, and they frequently throw away their hands 
when you raise. Thus, the chances of winning a double bet with 
a check-raise decrease.
There is one major time to deviate from the general 
check-raise formula, and that is when you think you can win three 
bets by betting, getting raised, and then reraising. A classic 
example of such a situation against an average player in 
seven-card stud occurs when you look like a straight on board but 
have a hidden full house, and your opponent may have a flush. 
You bet your apparent straight, your opponent raises with his 
flush, and you lift him out of his seat by reraising.
Heads-Up On The End 209
Playing Fair-to-Good Hands in 
First Position as a Favorite
In first position, with fair-to-good hands that are not strong 
enough to try a check-raise, you have three options — to bet, to 
check and call when your opponent bets, and to check and fold 
when your opponent bets. Which play you try in any given 
situation depends not so much upon the strength of your hand but 
upon your mathematical expectation for each play. And your 
expectation depends upon your ability to assess your opponent's 
style of play and what he is likely to do in a given situation. Some 
players bet with more hands than they call with; others call with 
more hands than they bet with; and still other, very tight players 
bet only when they are sure they have you beat. Thus, how you act 
in first position depends upon your knowledge of your opponent.
Here are the general rules for each play.
If your hand is worth a call or almost worth a call had you 
checked and your opponent bet, you should  bet  when your 
opponent is one who will call with more hands than he will bet, a 
habit which is typical of the majority of players.10
If your hand is worth a call, you should check and call when 
your opponent is one who will bet with more hands than he will 
call. As we shall see, this player is usually the type who may try 
to bluff after you have checked in first position.
You should check and fold when you are not the favorite if 
called and when your opponent is one who will almost always bet 
only with a hand that beats yours. This player may call with a few 
hands worse than yours. However, since this type will only bet 
with a hand that clearly beats you, the bets you save by folding 
after he bets are greater than the few bets you might pick up by 
betting and getting called by his worse hands.
The key factor in deciding whether to check-raise, bet, check 
and call, or check and fold in first position is, as we have seen,
10
See pages 213-214 for an 
exception to the rule.
210 Chapter Twenty-one
which of the plays has the greatest positive expectation or the 
least negative expectation.
Let's say that on a scale of 0 to 100 you have hand 80, a good 
hand but not a great hand. Your opponent could have anything 
from 0 to 100, with each hand equally likely. That would seem to 
make you a 4-to-1 favorite if you bet, but that's not at all the case. 
The question is, which hands will your opponent call with? If he 
will call only with hands 75 and upward, you are clearly an 
underdog if you bet — specifically a 4-to-1 underdog since you 
will lose to 20 of your opponent's hands and beat only five.
We'll assume you know your opponent will call with hands 
57 and upward. (We are, of course, being very hypothetical here 
since no player could know his opponent so precisely.) If your 
opponent will call with hands 57 and upward, that means that if 
you bet, you will win 23 times — when your opponent has hands 
57-79 — and lose 20 times — when he has hands 81-100. Thus 
you are a 23-to-20 favorite when you bet.
However, that does not mean the correct play is to bet. You 
still do not have enough information. You must also know what 
hands your opponent will bet if you check. Suppose your 
opponent will bet hands 62 and up if you check (which means you 
blow a bet if he has hands 57-61), but he will also bet with hands 
0-10. That is, there are eleven hands your opponent will bluff 
with. Once again there are 20 hands you will lose to (hands 81-
100), but now, instead of 23, there are 29 hands you will beat — 
hands 0-10 and hands 62-79. Thus, if you check and call when 
your opponent bets, you are a 29-to-20 favorite to show down the 
best hand. Clearly it is better to play the last round of betting as a 
29-to-20 favorite than as a 23-to-20 favorite, and so the correct 
play here is to check and call. This is the point of the rule: Check 
and call when your opponent will bet with more hands than he 
will call. By checking against such an opponent, you increase 
your chances of winning one last bet.
Suppose you are still a small favorite if you bet. Once again 
you have hand 80, and your new opponent will call with hands 57 
and up. But this opponent is much more timid than the other, and
Heads-Up On The End 211
you know he will bet only with hands 81 and upward. How should 
you play? It might at first seem correct to check and fold if your 
opponent bets, since any time he bets behind you he has you beat. 
However, when you check, you give up an even-money bet as a 
23-to-20 favorite, which cannot be correct. That's more than the 
vigorish that keeps bookmakers in business. After making that bet 
43 times, you will be ahead 3 units on average. Under no 
circumstances, then, can it be correct to check and fold if you are 
favored to win when your opponent calls you. As a 23-to-20 
favorite, the correct play here is to bet. The only time it might be 
correct to check is when you're not sure whether you're the 
favorite and when you're also worried about a raise that you will 
have to call.
Playing Fair-to-Good Hands in 
First Position as an Underdog
In cases where you think you're the underdog if called, the 
decision to bet or check becomes even more ticklish. Let's say 
there's $60 in the pot in a $ 10-$20 game, and again you have hand 
80. But this time you know your opponent will call only with 
hands 65 and up. Thus, you are a 20-to-15 underdog if your 
opponent calls. You also know that if you check, your opponent 
will bet with hands 70 and up. How should you play?
As an underdog, you might think you should check. But what 
will you do if your opponent bets after you check? Since there's 
$60 in the pot plus your opponent's $20, you're getting $80-to-
$20 or 4-to-1 odds from the pot, and we said your opponent will 
bet with hands 70-100. You have hand 80, and so you'll lose to 20 
hands and beat 10 hands. Since you are getting 4-to-1 from the pot 
and are only a 2-to-l underdog, clearly you must call when your 
opponent bets.
Look again at what happens when you bet. Your opponent 
will call with hands 65-100. By betting you've added five wins — 
when your opponent has hands 65-69 — to your possibilities.
212 Chapter Twenty-one
Instead of going in as a 20-to-10 underdog, which you would be 
doing if you checked, you're going in as a 20-to-15 underdog 
since you'll still lose to 20 hands, but now you will beat 15 hands 
instead of 10. So the correct play is to bet because betting here 
makes you less of an underdog than checking. Your hand is worth 
a call, and your opponent will call with more hands than he'll bet. 
(This play is something like splitting 8s in blackjack against the 
dealer's 10. You are still an underdog, but you are less of an 
underdog than if you had simply hit.)
Suppose with $60 in the pot you again have hand 80, and 
your opponent will again call with hands 65 and up. But this 
opponent will bet only with hands 82 and up. How should you 
play?
In the previous case you really didn't like your situation. You 
bet as a 20-to-15 underdog only because you would have had to 
call as a 20-to-10 underdog. But in the present case, in which you 
are still a 20-to-15 underdog if you bet, you don't have to worry 
about calling. Any time your opponent bets, you know he has you 
beat since he will only bet with hands 82 and up. You certainly 
don't want to bet as an underdog when you don't have to, so the 
correct play in this instance is to check and fold if your opponent 
bets. You blow a bet 15 times, when your opponent has hands 
65-79 and checks behind you, but you save a bet 20 times, when 
he has hands 81-100. You save more bets than you sacrifice. 
Checking and folding has greater expectation than betting as a 
20-to-15 underdog.
A curious situation develops, though, when you are an 
underdog when called and your opponent will bet if you check 
with only a few hands you can beat. It would seem that the correct 
play is to check and fold if your opponent bets. However, it often 
works out that the play with the greatest expectation is to bet your 
own underdog hands even though, if you checked, you could not 
call when your opponent bet. Depending upon the size of the pot, 
this situation occurs when your opponent will call with many 
hands you can beat but will bet with only a few hands you can 
beat.
Heads-Up On The End 213
Let's say there's $60 in the pot, and you have hand 80. You 
know your opponent will call with hands 65 and up (remember, 
we are being completely hypothetical here for the purposes of 
illustration), but he will bet only with hands 76 and up. Thus, if 
you check with hand 80 and your opponent bets, you will be a 
20-to-4 or a 5-to-1 underdog. Since you're only getting $80-
to-$20 or 4-to-1  odds from the pot, you cannot call. However, 
when you yourself bet, you add 11 wins to your possibilities — 
when your opponent has hands 65-75 — thus creating a situation 
where you are getting favorable odds from the pot.
Here's  how  this  situation  works  out  mathematically. 
Remember that we know your opponent will call with hands 65 
and up but he will bet only with hands 76 and up. All the hands 
are equally likely. Thus if you check and fold when he bets then 
in 100 times you will win $60 76 times when he has hands 0-75) 
for a total of $4,560. However if you bet you will win $60 65 
times and $80 15 times while losing $20 20 times. This works out 
to $4,700 which is $140 more than you would have won by 
checking and folding if your opponent bet. Consequently, even 
though as an underdog you would not call if your opponent bet on 
the end, it may sometimes be right for you to bet, depending upon 
the size of the pot and the number of second-best hands you think 
your opponent will call with.
Finally, there are some unusual situations, when the pot is 
fairly large and your opponent is somewhat timid, where it may 
be correct to check and call even though your opponent would 
call you with more hands than he would bet himself. This is the 
exception we referred to earlier to the general rule that you should 
bet when your opponent will call with more hands than he would 
bet.
Suppose you have hand 80. You're playing in a $10-$20 
game, and there's $200 in the pot. You know your opponent will 
call only with hands 75 and up; so you're a 4-to-1 underdog if you 
bet But you'd be getting at least 10-to-l from the pot, so a bet 
could be right.  However, you also know your opponent is afraid 
tо  bet for value on many hands that beat you — say, hands 81 -90
.
214 Chapter Twenty-one
This opponent will bet hands 91-100 and he may occasionally 
bluff— say, with hands 1-4. Even though this opponent will bet 
with fewer hands than he would call with, and even though the pot 
odds you're getting make your hand worth a call, it nevertheless 
becomes correct to check in this instance. The reason is that ten 
times — in the cases where your opponent has hands 81-90 — 
you save  $20  when he checks the best hand behind you. 
Furthermore, when your opponent does bet and you call, you're 
only a 10-to-4 or 2!/2-to-l underdog instead of the 20-to-5 or 4-
to-1 underdog you would be if you came out betting. You've 
also eliminated the possibility of getting raised in a situation 
where, given the size of the pot, you would almost have to call.
It becomes correct to check and call, though you know your 
opponent would call with more hands than he would bet, if when 
you are an underdog you think your opponent will check some 
better hands behind you and if you fear a raise.
Remember, though, that the last two situations we have 
described are unusual. The general rules still apply the majority 
of the time. If your hand is worth a call, you should bet when your 
opponent will call with more hands than he will bet, and you 
should check and call when your opponent will bet with more 
hands than he will check. In other words, you should make the 
play that gives you the greatest number of wins and the smallest 
number of losses.
First Position Play in Practice
Let us now see how first-position play heads-up on the end 
works in practice.
Suppose in draw poker you draw three cards in first position 
and make aces up. Your opponent draws one card. He may have 
two pair, or he may be drawing to a straight or a flush. You feel 
that this type of player will call with two pair if you bet but will 
bet them for value if you check. How should you play?
There's no mystery here. Clearly you should check and call. 
By checking and calling, you may save a bet in one situation and
Heads-Up On The End 215
gain a bet in another. With two pair, your opponent will call if you 
bet and bet if you check. So you win either way. If your opponent 
was drawing to a flush or a straight and makes it, he will of course 
bet if you check, but he will call, or probably raise, if you bet — 
which will cost you an extra bet if you call the raise. With a 
busted hand, your opponent will not call if you bet, so you gain 
nothing by betting. However, your opponent might bet on a bluff 
if you check. In this single instance you win an extra bet by 
checking and calling. So checking and calling has greater 
expectation than betting. And to repeat: The object of poker is not 
to win pots but to win money; it is with these extra bets won or 
saved that you win money.
Here is another draw poker situation. You draw one card to 
two small pair, and your opponent draws three. You don't 
improve. You know your opponent suspects you were drawing to 
a flush or a straight, and you also know this player's a pay station, 
the type who will call "to keep you honest." How should you 
play?
You should bet. Assuming your opponent was drawing three 
to a big pair, you're about a 71 percent favorite to have the best 
hand. Any time you're even a small favorite against someone you 
know is going to call virtually every time, you should bet. In this 
case you're wagering even money as a  71  percent or  5-to-2 
favorite. Clearly that's a wager with positive expectation even 
though you expect to lose 29 percent of the time.
Suppose in hold 'em you have
(Notice that there is no flush possibility.) You are first to act. How 
should you play?
You should probably come out betting. If you are up against 
something like A, 10 or K,10 or J,10, you lose either way. If you 
check, your opponent will surely bet, and you will call. If your 
opponent has Q, 10, you may lose a double bet by betting out since 
your opponent will raise. On the other hand, if your opponent has 
hands like 10,8 or 10,7 or 10,6, you win either way; if you check, 
your opponent will most likely bet. However, two very possible 
hands your opponent might have are A,Q and K,Q which he may 
very well not bet if you check but with which he will probably 
call if you bet. Since you are likely to gain a bet more frequently 
than you lose one (when your opponent raises), betting has greater 
expectation than checking and calling. Put in terms of the rules 
given earlier, in this situation your opponent will call with more 
hands than he will bet.
A  final  set  of  examples  from  draw  lowball  should 
demonstrate how your play on the end in first position varies 
directly in terms of your opponent. Both players in the pot draw 
one card, and you are first to act:
Heads-Up On The End 217
You are up against a player who doesn't bluff but is always afraid 
everyone else does. How should you act?
You should bet. Your opponent will probably call with a 
queen-low or better, while only a seven-low or better will beat 
you. Therefore your opponent will call with many hands that you 
will beat and a relative few that will beat you. On the other hand, 
if you checked, your opponent would not bet most of those losing 
hands. Thus, you stand to win more often by betting than by 
checking.
Suppose you have the same hand in draw lowball against an 
aggressive, tough player, and you're first. How should you play?
In this case, you should check and call because your 
opponent is likely to bet more hands than he calls with. Besides 
beating your opponent's rough 8s, you also snap off his bluffs, 
which you could not do if you came out betting. Ordinarily, if you 
bet, your opponent would give up the idea of bluffing. In general, 
a player who bets with more hands than he calls with is the type 
of player who not only bets for value but also bluffs perhaps more 
often than is correct. Thus, when you check, your opponent's 
bluffing hands are added to those he bets for value.
Now suppose instead of a perfect eight-low, you have the 
following hand:
You
You
Once again you're up against that player who never 
bluffs but
worries that everyone else does. You're first. How 
should you play?
Here you should check and fold if your opponent 
bets. Since your  hand  beats only queen-,Jack-, and ten-
lows (the losing hands
216 Chapter Twenty-one
and the board at the end is
218 Chapter Twenty-one
with which your opponent would call), it is no longer worth a bet 
for value, because you get beat with his nine-lows and better. And 
since this opponent never bets on a bluff, you should fold in the 
face of a bet. The odds that you are beat are overwhelming.
Against the aggressive player, you would also check, but you 
would call a bet since there are many hands this opponent might 
be betting that you can beat. In other words, a call against this 
type of player would have positive expectation.
First Position Play in Terms of 
the Strength of Your Hand
We'll wrap up play in first position by summarizing it 
according to the strength of your hand.
If your hand is a cinch or a near cinch, you have two options. 
One is to bet, and one is to check-raise. You would decide which 
to do according to the check-raise formula presented earlier. 
However, if you are sure you have the best hand but suspect your 
opponent will raise if you bet, you should bet out in an attempt to 
win three bets when your opponent raises and you reraise.
If your hand figures to be a favorite when called but is not 
good enough to check-raise, you have two options — to bet or to 
check and then call. Basically you bet if your opponent will call 
with more hands than he'll bet with and you check and call if he'll 
bet with more hands than he'll call with.
If your hand is an underdog when called, you have three 
options. One is to bet, a second is to check and call, and the third 
is to check and fold. (A bluff check-raise is a remote possibility 
against very tough players who are capable of very tough folds.) 
You should check and call if your opponent will bet more hands 
than he will call with, including some hands you can beat. You 
should also check and call when your opponent will check many 
hands that will beat you but might come out bluffing with some 
hands you can beat. And you should come out betting if you have
Heads-Up On The End 219
a calling hand but your opponent will call with more hands than 
he will bet.
Finally, if you have virtually no chance of winning if you 
check and your opponent bets and you are an underdog if you bet 
and he calls, then the proper play is to check and fold if he bets.
Summary
The concepts in this long chapter are important and slippery 
enough to warrant a final framing in an outline summary. The 
essence of each play is a judgment of its expectation.
I. Last Position Play
A.
If you are second to act when all the cards are out and your
opponent bets:
1.Call if your hand is not worth a raise but has a better
chance of winning than the pot odds you are getting.
Your chances of winning are the sum of the chances that
your opponent is bluffing, plus the chances that your
hand can beat his legitimate hand.
2.Raise if your opponent will still be the underdog after
calling your raise. Raise also as a bluff if you think it
will work often enough to have positive expectation.
Also consider raising with what appears to be a calling
hand if your opponent is capable of throwing away a
better hand than yours for one more bet.
B.
If you are second to act when all the cards are out and your
opponent checks:
1.Bluff if you  think   it  will   work  often   enough,
remembering that a bluff does not tend to work as often
in second position as it might in first position.
2.Bet your hand for value if you are a favorite to have the
best hand, even when your opponent calls your bet.
Don't bet in close situations to avoid a check-raise.
220 Chapter Twenty-one
II. First Position Play
A.
If you are first to act when all the cards are out and have a
very strong hand:
1.Try to check-raise if your opponent will bet and call
your raise more than half as often as he will call you
when you bet.
2.Come out betting if you don't think a check-raise will
work often enough to be profitable or if you think you
can win three bets when your opponent raises and you
reraise.
B.
If you are first to act and have a bad hand:
1.Bluff if you can get away with it often enough for the
play to have positive expectation.
2.Otherwise check and fold if your opponent bets.
С   If you are first to act and have a hand that is a favorite to win 
if called but not strong enough for you to try a check-raise:
1.Bet if your opponent will call with more hands than he
will bet with if you check.
2.Check and call if your opponent will bet with more
hands than he will call with.
3.Never check and fold.
D.   If you are first to act and have a hand that is a small underdog 
to win when your bet is called:
1.Bet if your opponent will call with more hands than he
will bet, as long as some of the hands he would have bet,
had you checked, would be worse than yours. Check and
call if you think your opponent will check behind you
with a significant number of hands better than yours but
might still bluff with some hands you can beat.
2.Check and call if your opponent will bet with more
hands than he will call with, as long as your pot odds
make it worth calling when he does bet.
3.Check and fold if your opponent will almost never bet a
hand worse than yours.
Chapter Twenty-two  
Reading Hands
The ability to read hands may be the most important weapon 
a poker player can have. As the Fundamental Theorem of Poker 
suggests, the key mistake in poker is to play your hand differently 
from the way you would play it if you knew what your opponent 
had. The more often you play your hand correctly on the basis of 
what your opponent has the less you give up and the more you 
gain. If you somehow knew what your opponent had every time, 
you almost couldn't lose because you would always play 
correctly. It follows, then, that the better you are at reading your 
opponents' hands, the closer you come to perfect play, and the 
closer you come to perfect play, the less you lose and the more 
you win.
Reading hands is both an art and a science. It is an art 
because you must know your opponents. Before you can 
technically analyze what your opponents might have, you must 
have played with them for a considerable length of time, seen how 
they play their hands against you, and most importantly, watched 
them play hands in which you are not involved. Even when you 
are not in a hand, you should not relax your concentration. You 
want to discover how your opponents tend to play the various 
hands they might have. Will a particular opponent raise with 
strong hands in early position, or will he slowplay? Will he raise 
on a draw? How does he play his big hands from one round of 
betting to the next? How often does he bluff? The more you know 
about an opponent's general playing habits, the less difficulty you 
will have reading what he might be holding in a specific situation.
Ironically, it is not as hard to read good players as it is to read 
a bunch of incompetents. When a good player makes a play, there 
is a sensible reason for it, and your job is to find the reason and 
Put that player on a hand. But there is no pattern to the play of a
221
222 Chapter Twenty-two
weak player, and so you must do a great deal of tentative 
guesswork to put him on a hand. Nevertheless, by playing solidly 
against weak, unpredictable players, you have to win eventually. 
Sooner or later a sound, logical poker player must beat someone 
playing by the seat of his pants. The latter may get lucky for a 
while, catching the inside straights he draws to, winning with two 
small pair when you raised with aces on third street, but 
percentages are bound to catch up with him. Many good players 
get upset when a sucker draws out on them. While it's never 
pleasant to lose a pot you were favored to win, you should 
nevertheless welcome these beats. Congratulate such players on 
hanging in there to make their hands. Encourage them so they 
play even more sloppily. It shouldn't be long before you have 
their money.
The more you play against average-to-good players, the 
easier it becomes to read your opponents' hands because they tend 
to check, bet, and raise for logical reasons and with a certain 
consistency to their play. However, as your opponents get tougher 
and tougher, your ability to read hands starts to fall off because 
tough players disguise their hands and they are sometimes 
intentionally inconsistent. They make tricky, ambiguous plays like 
semi-bluffing,  like  raising  with  the  second-best  hand,  like 
slowplaying right to the end and then check-raising you. They 
may even play a hand as it would normally be played, which can 
sometimes be the most deceptive play of all. In a word, they do all 
the sorts of things we have been discussing in this book. They are 
trying as hard to deceive you about what they have as you are 
trying to discover what they have. And of course, you are 
presumably playing your hands equally hard against them, even 
as you are trying to read their hands.
Reading Hands 223
Reading Hands on the Basis of Your 
Opponents' Play and Exposed Cards
There are two universally applicable techniques for reading 
hands in all poker games and one more for open-handed games 
like seven-card stud, razz, and hold 'em. Most commonly you 
analyze the meaning of an opponent's check, bet, or raise, and in 
open-handed games you look at his exposed cards and try to judge 
from them what his entire hand might be. You then combine the 
plays he has made throughout the hand with his exposed cards 
and come to a determination about his most likely hand.
Here is a simple problem in reading hands that should make 
this point clear. The game is seven-card stud, and your opponents 
are decent players:
Player A
Player В
You
Player A with the pair of aces showing bets; Player В with 
the pair of kings showing calls; and Player С with the pair of 
queens showing calls. There are no raises. You are last to act. 
How should you play your three 7s?
If you combine what you see on board with what your 
opponents have done, there should be no doubt in your mind that 
you must fold; your three 7s have no chance whatsoever. The 
crucial factor is that the pair of queens overcalled. Player A may 
be betting with aces alone. But when Player В calls him, Player В 
must have at least kings up. Being a decent player, Player С 
knows this. Therefore, С could not call without having kings up 
beat. What are C's possible hands? Well, С cannot have aces and 
queens or kings and queens because there's a third ace and a third 
king out, making it impossible for С to have two of either. So, he 
must have three queens or better, and while your three 7s might 
beat the first two hands, they cannot beat C's three queens or 
better. Therefore, you fold.
Here is a good example of this kind of hand reading, which 
to my chagrin cost me half a pot. I was playing five-card stud 
high-low split with a replace on the end. With an ace and an 8
Reading Hands 225
showing, I called the maximum raises on third street even though 
two other players each had a 6 and a 5 showing. There was 
another player in the pot with an obvious pair of kings. When it 
got down to the last card, I had A,8,6,3 showing. One 6,5 had 
folded, but despite the strength of my board, the other stayed with 
a ragged 6,5,10,Q showing. And of course, the pair of kings 
stayed. Now I was betting and raising, hoping the Q, 10 low would 
get out. But that player read me too well. He didn't even take the 
opportunity to replace one of his cards.
What I was trying to do was win the whole pot, the high and 
the low, from the two kings, but the Q, 10 low was clever enough 
to figure out my hand. He said to himself, "Sklansky is 
representing an 8 low, but could he have an 8 low? No, he 
couldn't. Why? Because he would never have called all those 
raises on third street with three cards to an 8 low when there were 
two other players in the pot who looked as if they had three cards 
to a 6 low. Therefore, he must have another ace in the hole." He 
was, of course, absolutely right. I won the high with my two aces, 
beating the two kings, but the Q,10 low was rewarded for his 
accurate reading with the low half of the pot (which I would have 
won against the two kings with my two aces counting also as a 
low pair). The player with the Q,10 low considered the way I 
played the hand not just at the end, but from the beginning, and he 
combined my play with the cards showing to arrive at the correct 
conclusion about what I was holding. He also analyzed the order 
in which I received my upcards. He knew I started with A,8 and 
then caught the 6 and the 3. If he had not known that — if, for 
example, he had not been sure whether I started with A,8 or A,6 
- it would have been impossible for him to conclude with such 
certainty that I had a pair of aces.
It is in this way that you use logic to read hands. You
interpret   your  opponents'   plays   on   each   round,   and   in
open-handed games you note the cards they catch on each round,
Paying close attention to the order in which they catch them. You
then put these two pieces of evidence together — the plays and
Player С
224 Chapter Twenty-two
226 Chapter Twenty-two
the upcards — to draw a conclusion about an opponent's most 
likely hand.
In that high-low split hand, the Q,10 low was able to put me 
on a specific hand quite early. However, it is generally a mistake 
to put someone on a specific hand early and then stick to your 
initial conclusion no matter how things develop. A player who 
raises on third street in seven-card stud with a king showing may 
have two kings, but he may also have a small pair in the hole with 
the king kicker or a three-flush or a J,Q,K or a number of other 
hands as well. Drawing a narrow, irreversible conclusion early can 
lead to costly mistakes later, either because you fold with the best 
hand or because you stay in as a big underdog.
What you do in a game like seven-card stud or hold 'em or 
razz is to put an opponent on a variety of hands at the start of play, 
and as the hand continues, you eliminate some of those hands 
based on his later play and on the cards he catches. Through this 
process of elimination, you should have a good idea of what that 
opponent has (or is drawing to.) when the last card is dealt.
Suppose, for instance, in seven-card stud a player starts with 
a queen of spades, then catches the deuce of spades, then the 7 of 
spades, then the 5 of hearts, and he's betting all the way. You 
have a pair of 10s which does not improve. Your opponent bets on 
the end, and clearly you can beat only a bluff. The question is — 
might your opponent be bluffing? With something like a four-
flush and a small pair, he would probably have played the hand 
exactly the same way — semi-bluffing right to the end, assuming 
you didn't catch any dangerous-looking cards. Therefore, while 
your opponent may, in fact, have a pair of queens or queens up, 
there's also a chance he has a busted hand. Very possibly you 
should call his final bet, given the pot odds you're getting — but 
realizing at the same time that he may indeed have been semi-
bluffing yet still caught his hand on the last card.
Suppose, on the other hand, your seven-stud opponent started 
with that same queen of spades and you with that same pair of 
10s. Once again your opponent is betting all the way. But this 
time he catches the 7 of diamonds, then the 4 of clubs, then the
Reading Hands 227
jack of hearts. Now when he bets on the end, you should almost 
certainly fold your two unimproved 10s because when he caught 
the
and
but continued betting, you had to eliminate 
the  flush draw as one of his possible hands. Therefore, he is 
almost certainly betting on the end for value with at least a pair of 
queens
___more likely two pair. Ironically, it can sometimes occur that
because your opponent's hand looks less dangerous on board it is 
more of a threat to have you beat when your opponent bets on the 
end, because nothing showing suggests he might have been 
semi-bluffing as the hand progressed.
At the end of a hand it becomes especially crucial to have a 
good idea of what your opponent has. The more accurately you 
can read hands on the end, the better you can decide whether you 
have, for example, a 20 percent chance of having your opponent 
beat or a 60 percent chance or whatever. You use your ability to 
read hands to come up with these percentages and then decide 
how to play your own hand.
In practice, most players don't arrive at exact figures like  20 
percent or 60 percent, but at the very least they try to decide 
whether their opponent has a bad hand, a mediocre hand, a good 
hand, or a great hand. Let's say your opponent bets on the end. 
Usually when a person bets, it represents either a bluff, a good 
hand, or a great hand, but not a mediocre hand. If your opponent 
had a mediocre hand, he would probably check. If you have only 
a mediocre hand yourself, you have to decide what the chances 
are that your opponent is bluffing and whether those chances 
warrant a call in relation to the pot odds. If you have a very good 
hand, you must decide whether your opponent has a good hand or 
a great hand. If you think the chances are high he has only a good 
hand, you would raise. But if you think he may very well have a 
great hand, you would just call. If you are virtually certain he has 
a great hand, you might even fold your very good hand, depending 
upon the size of the pot. You ask yourself two questions: What 
does it look like my opponent is  representing? Could he have 
the hand he's representing and have played it the way he did? 
Once aw your conclusions about your opponent's hand on the
228 Chapter Twenty-two
basis of his play and his upcards, you decide on the basis of your 
own holding and the size of the pot whether to bet, check, call, 
raise, or whatever.
We have seen that in open-handed games one way to read 
hands is to start by considering a variety of possible hands an 
opponent  might  have  and  then  eliminate  some  of  those 
possibilities as the hand develops. A second or, more accurately, 
a complementary way to read hands is to work backward. It is that 
sort of thing my high-low split opponent did. If, for instance, the 
last card in hold 'em is a deuce and an opponent who'd been quiet 
from the start suddenly bets, you think back on his play in earlier 
rounds. If there was betting on the flop or on fourth street, that 
player would not have called with nothing but two 2s in the hole. 
So he is betting now either as a bluff or because he has something 
other than three 2s. If, on the other hand, everyone checked on the 
flop and on fourth street, it's very possible the player caught three 
2s on the end. Every step of the way you must work forward and 
backward to zero in on your opponent's most likely hand.
Using Mathematics to Read Hands
When you can't actually put a person on a hand but have 
reduced his possible hands to a limited number, you try to use 
mathematics to determine the chances of his having certain hands 
rather than others. Then you decide what kind of hand you must 
have to continue playing. Using mathematics is particularly 
important in draw poker, where your main clue to what an 
opponent might have is what you know about his opening, calling, 
and raising requirements.
If, for example, you know an opponent will raise you with 
three 2s or better before the draw, you can resort to mathematics 
to determine what hand is favored to have him beat. It works out 
to something like three queens. Obviously, then, if you have three 
3s, it's not worth calling that opponent's raise on the chance that 
he has specifically three 2s. But if you have something like three 
5s or three 6s, the pot odds make it correct to call because now not
Reading Hands 229
only might you draw out on a better hand by making a full house 
or four-of-a-kind, but there are a few hands your opponent could 
have which you already have beat.
Sometimes you can use a mathematical procedure based on 
Bayes' Theorem to determine the chances an opponent has one or 
another hand. After deciding upon the kinds of hands your 
opponent would be betting in a particular situation, you determine 
the probability of his holding each of those hands. Then you 
compare those probabilities. If, for instance, in draw poker you 
know a particular player will open either with three-of-a-kind or 
two pair but will not open with one pair and will check as a 
slowplay with a pat hand, then it is 5-to-2 against that player's 
having trips when he does open. Why is this so? On average, 
according to draw poker distribution, a player will be dealt two 
pair 5 percent of the time and trips 2 percent of the time. When 
you compare these two percentages, you arrive at a ratio of 5-to-2. 
Therefore, the player is a 5-to-2 favorite to have two pair.
Let's say in hold 'em an opponent puts in a big raise before 
the flop, and you read him for the type of player who will raise 
only with two aces, two kings, or ace, king. The probability that 
a player gets two aces on the first two cards is 0.45 percent. The 
probability of his getting two kings is also 0.45 percent. So he will 
get two aces or two kings 0.9 percent of the time on average. The 
probability of his getting an ace, king is  1.2  percent. By 
comparing these two probabilities — 1.2 percent and .9 percent— 
you deduce that the chances are 4-to-3 in favor of your opponent's 
having ace, king rather than two aces or two kings. Of course, 
knowing your opponent is a 4-to-3 favorite to have ace, king is not 
enough by itself to justify calling his raise with, say, two queens. 
You are a small favorite if he does have ace, king, but you're a big 
underdog if he has two aces or two kings. Nevertheless, the more 
you know about the chances of an opponent's having one hand 
rather than another when he bets or raises, the easier it is for you 
to decide whether to fold, call, or raise. Earlier in this chapter we 
talked about a player in seven-card
stud raising  on third street with a king showing, and we 
pointed
230 Chapter Twenty-two
out that he might have two kings, but he might also have a small 
pair or a three-flush or something like J,Q,K. To simplify, we'll 
assume you know this particular player will raise only with a pair 
of kings or a three-flush. You have a pair of queens. The 
probability is about 11 percent before the raise that your opponent 
has another king in the hole to make a pair of kings, and it's about 
5 percent that he has three of the same suit. This is simply the 
mathematical  probability based on card distribution and has 
nothing to do with any action the player takes. Therefore, when 
your opponent raises, which now limits his possible hands on the 
basis of what you know about him to either two kings or a three-
flush, he is an ll-to-5 favorite to have the two kings, and you 
would probably fold your two queens. However, another king 
showing  somewhere  on  the  table  radically  reduces  the 
mathematical probability of your opponent's having two kings 
before he raises because there are only two kings instead of three 
among the unseen cards. The probability of your opponent's 
having two kings is cut to about ТА percent. A raise now makes 
it about 40 percent that your opponent has a three-flush rather 
than two kings. Depending upon your position, your queens may 
be strong enough to justify a call. In this case you read your 
opponent's hand not just on the basis of what you know about 
him, the action he takes, and the exposed card you see, but also on 
the basis of a mathematical comparison of his possible hands.
It does not, of course, take a mathematical genius to realize 
that another king on the table decreases the chances of an 
opponent's having two kings before he raises, so using math to 
read hands does not always require the precise knowledge of 
card-distribution probabilities presented here. Furthermore, you 
need to complement mathematical conclusions with what you 
know about a player. For example, in a relatively small-ante 
game, some players might not raise with two kings when there is 
no other king showing in hopes of making a big hand, but they 
will raise with two kings when there is a king showing to try to 
win the pot right there. They decide to go for the pot right away 
precisely because of the presence of that other king, which
Reading Hands 231
reduces their chances of improving. When you are up against such 
players, the presence of another king might actually increase the 
probability of their having two kings after they raise — not on the 
basis of mathematics but on the basis of the action they have taken 
and what you know about the way they play.
Reading Hands in Multi-Way Pots
Another factor in reading hands and deciding how to play 
your own is the number of players in the pot. Any time someone 
bets and someone else calls, you are in a more precarious position 
than when it is just up to you to call. In general, a caller ahead of 
you makes it necessary for you to tighten up significantly because 
you no longer have the extra equity that the bettor may be 
bluffing. Whether he is bluffing or not, the second player must 
have something to call. Therefore, when your hand is barely worth 
a call in a heads-up situation because of the extra chance of 
catching a bluff, it is not worth an overcall when someone else has 
called ahead of you.
Here is an example of such a situation that came up in a small 
ante razz game I was playing. On the first three cards I had an:
A decent hand but not a great one. The high card brought it in, and 
a player called with a 5 showing. I was prepared to call or 
possibly raise. However, a player ahead of me, who was playing 
tight, raised with a 4 showing. Had the first player with the 5 
showing not called the initial bet, I would have called the raiser 
with my 8,5,2 because, though the raiser was playing tight, there 
would have been a chance he was semi-bluffing. But since the 
raiser raised another low card that had already called, it was
232 Chapter Twenty-two
almost a certainty he had a better hand than I did; and there was 
also the probability the first caller had a good hand. Therefore, 
given the small ante, my hand was no longer worth a call.
The same sort of thinking must be employed when deciding 
whether to call a raise cold. With very few exceptions, you need 
a better hand to call a raise cold than you would need to raise 
yourself. The simple logic of this principle can be set forth 
through an example from draw poker. Let's say in the game you 
are playing you decide to raise before the draw with aces up or 
better. You look at your hand and find you have three 2s. You're 
prepared to raise, but all of a sudden the player to your right, who 
will also raise with aces up or better, puts in a raise. Now instead 
of raising, you can't even call. You must fold because the chances 
are too good that the raiser has you beat.
This principle applies to any game. When you have a 
minimum or near-minimum raising hand and the player to your 
right, who has the same standards as yours, raises ahead of you, 
then his hand is probably better than yours, and your correct play 
is to fold.
Summary
Reading hands well is a powerful poker weapon because it 
allows you to play correctly more often, according to the 
Fundamental Theorem of Poker. The better you read your 
opponents' hands, the less likely you are to play your hand 
differently from the way you would play it if you could actually 
see what your opponents had. Weak players are difficult to read 
because there is little pattern to their play. Good players are easier 
because there is logic to their play. However, very tough players 
are more difficult to read because of their ability to disguise their 
hands.
One way to read hands is to put opponents on a variety of 
possible hands and eliminate some of them on the basis of their 
play and the cards they catch from one round to the next, keeping 
track of the order in which they catch their cards. A second,
Reading Hands 233
complementary way is to work backward, looking at an 
opponent's later plays in terms of how he played his hand in 
earlier rounds.
You can also read hands by using mathematics, by comparing 
possible hands on the basis of Bayes' Theorem. If you know an 
opponent will bet only certain hands, you form a ratio based on 
the probability of that opponent being dealt each of those hands. 
To simplify, you can divide his possible hands between those you 
can beat and those you can't beat. The ratio tells you which of the 
hands he is favored to have.
Finally, when reading hands you must consider the number 
of people in the pot. When there is a caller ahead of you, the caller 
and the original bettor cannot both be bluffing, so you must play 
on the assumption that you are up against at least one legitimate 
hand. When there is a raiser ahead of you with the same standards 
as yours, you should have more than your minimum raising hand 
to call that raiser because you have to figure your minimal raising 
hand is beat.
Throughout this chapter it has been implicitly suggested that 
a significant aspect of reading hands is knowing your opponents. 
Which leads us to the next chapter, "The Psychology of Poker."
Chapter Twenty-three  
The Psychology of Poker
Psychological Plays
The late John Crawford was one of the great game players 
and gamblers of all time. His best games were bridge and 
backgammon, but he was also an excellent gin rummy player. He 
and the legendary games expert Oswald Jacoby used to play gin 
rummy against each other constantly. They were close in ability, 
but there was no question Crawford had the psychological edge. 
He would needle Jacoby, taunt him, even laugh at his play, until 
Jacoby sometimes became so enraged he could hardly see the 
cards in front of him.
Along the same lines, Los Angeles backgammon pro Gaby 
Horowitz is well-known for his glib, sometimes disparaging talk 
during a game, which is calculated to put his opponents on tilt. 
Seven-card stud poker pro Danny Robinson is equally famous for 
his nonstop patter during a hand, which is used to distract and 
confuse his opponents.
These are all psychological ploys, and there are an endless 
number of such ploys. Some people approve of them. Some don't. 
While they have a definite place in poker, they are not what we 
mean by the psychology of poker. They are psychological devices 
that apply to all games or, for that matter, to all forms of 
competition. Chess champion Bobby Fischer used them in his 
famous match against Soviet master Boris Spassky. Managers like 
Earl Weaver and Billy Martin use them on the baseball diamond. 
And the late Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was notorious for 
using them as tactics of cold war diplomacy.

The Thought Processes of Poker
What we mean by the psychology of poker is getting into 
your opponents' heads, analyzing how they think, figuring out 
what they think you think, and even determining what they think 
you think they think. In this sense the psychology of poker is an 
extension of reading opponents' hands, and it is also an extension 
of using deception in the way you play your own hand.
Recently, while I was working on this book, a friend ran up 
to me and said, "I made a great play in seven-stud last night at the 
Castaways." We had recently been talking about using deception 
by betting a second-best hand to make an opponent think you are 
stronger than you really are in hopes he will fold if you improve.
"Low card brought it in, and I called with a pair of kings," 
my friend began. "One of the kings was showing. Behind me a 
guy who was steaming and almost all-in called with an ace 
showing. He could have anything. Another guy, A.D., the best 
player in the game, raised with an ace showing. We all called.
"On fourth street I catch a 5.1 have a king, 5 showing — still 
only a pair of kings. The guy who's steaming has ace, 10, and he 
bets. Maybe he has a small pair. The good player calls. Now I 
know for sure the good player has aces because he would never 
call another ace unless he had aces himself, especially with me 
sitting behind him with, maybe, two kings. He's played with me 
a lot, and he knows how I play."
"So you folded your pair of kings."
"No, I raised!"
"That's pretty dangerous in that spot," I said.
"Well, I knew A.D. had aces," My friend continued, "and I 
knew he knew I knew he had aces. So when I raise, he has to 
figure that since I know he has aces, I must have made kings up. 
The guy who's steaming calls, and A.D. reluctantly calls. Then I 
get lucky. I make an open pair of 5s on fifth street, and I bet out. 
The guy who's steaming goes all-in, but A.D. shakes his head and 
folds his two aces because now he's worried I've made a full 
house — 5s full of kings. I end up winning the hand with kings
The Psychology of Poker 237
and 5s against a pair of 10s. A.D. grumbled afterward that he's 
the one who should have been raising."
My friend did get lucky when he paired the 5s. However, in 
claying the hand he demonstrated the kind of thought processes 
that are the principal subject of this chapter. He went three steps 
beyond what he saw on the board. First, he thought about what his 
opponents might have. He tentatively put the steamer on a small 
pair, and with more assurance he put A.D. on a pair of aces. Then 
he went one step further. He thought about what A.D. thought he 
had — namely, a pair of kings. Then he went a step beyond that. 
He thought about what A.D. thought he thought A.D. had — and 
he knew A.D. knew that he thought A.D. had two aces. It was 
only after reaching this third level that he decided to raise with a 
pair of kings to make A.D. think he had kings up. Of course, it 
was also important that A.D. was a good enough player to think 
on a second and third level himself. Otherwise the play would 
make no sense. Just as you can't put a weak player on a hand, you 
can't put him on a thought either. A weak player might reraise 
with two aces, without analyzing the possibility that the other man 
might have kings up.
Very sophisticated poker play can go considerably beyond 
the third level. An instance of such play came up at the Sahara in 
Las Vegas in a tough seven-card stud game. One player had:
The pair of 6s bet on the end; the A,K raised with aces and kings; 
and the pair of 6s called with 6s up. On the surface it may seem as 
if the 6s up made a sucker play in betting, that the aces and kings 
took a big chance in raising a possible flush or trips, and that the 
6s up made another sucker play in calling the raise. In a typical 
game, the two small pair would no doubt check on the end, and 
the aces and kings might very well check behind him to avoid a 
check-raise. However, the thinking of the two players in this game 
was much more complicated.
First, the
was betting all the way; that player knew,
therefore, that his opponent put him on a four-flush. So with two 
small pair he bet for value on the end because he knew his 
opponent thought he had a four-flush, and he figured the opponent 
would call with one pair to snap off a bluff. The A,K took it a step 
further. He thought the pair of 6s might in fact be betting two pair 
for value because he knew the man with the two 6s thought he put 
him on a four-flush and that therefore the man with two 6s would 
bet two pair to get a call from one pair. So the A,K raised for 
value, thinking his opponent might think he was raising with only 
one pair. The man with the 6s up was hoping exactly that, and 
given the size of the pot, he felt his hand had enough of a chance 
to justify calling the raise. If the pair of 6s' first two up-cards had 
not been the same suit, the aces and kings would never have 
considered raising the bet on the end. At best, he would only have 
had a crying call because with two small pair the other player 
would probably have checked since he couldn't represent a flush 
draw. But with those diamonds showing each opponent was trying 
to outwit the other, and the aces and kings ended up getting the
The Psychology of Poker 239
best of the situation. The 6s up didn't reraise, of course, 
representing a flush, because he knew that at that point the pot 
was so large his opponent would certainly call with something 
like aces up.
At the expert level of poker, the dialectic of trying to outwit 
your opponent can sometimes extend to so many levels that you 
must finally abandon psychology altogether and rely on game 
theory. It is precisely when judgment fails that game theory 
becomes so useful. However, in ordinary play against good 
players, you should think at least up to the third level. First, think 
about what your opponent has. Second, think about what your 
opponent thinks you have. And third, think about what your 
opponent thinks you think he has. Only when you are playing 
against weak players, who might not bother to think about what 
you have and who almost certainly don't think about what you 
think they have, does it not necessarily pay to go through such 
thought processes. Against all others it is crucial to successful 
play, especially when deception is a big part of the game.
Calling on the Basis of What 
Your Opponent Thinks
There is a very important principle based on thinking about what 
your  opponent  thinks  you  have,  and  it  is  this:  When  an 
opponent bets in a situation where he is sure you are going to call, 
he is not bluffing. This point is obvious, yet many players 
overlook it. What it means is if you create the impression — by 
the way you have played your hand, by the look of your board, by 
the action you have put in the pot, or even by artificial means — 
that you are going to call a bet, an opponent who bets is betting 
value. He figures to have you beat because he knows you are 
going to call. Therefore, you should fold if he bets unless your 
hand warrants a call on the value of the hand. You should 
certainly fold a   mediocre hand that can beat only a bluff; 
clearly
238 Chapter Twenty-three
Another had:
240 Chapter Twenty-three
no one but an idiot would bluff when he is sure he's going to get 
called.
A prime example of such a situation arises when you bet on 
the end and a player raises you. It is very rare to find an opponent 
who is capable of raising on the end as a bluff. It is even rarer to 
find an opponent who would raise on a bluff when you have been 
betting all the way and have, therefore, given every indication of 
paying off a raise. So against all but very tough players capable of 
such a bluff raise, you should fold a routine hand because your 
opponent wouldn't raise without a good hand. Similarly, if you 
raise on the end and your opponent reraises, you should usually 
fold unless your hand can beat some of the legitimate hands with 
which he might be reraising.11 In sum, when deciding whether to 
call a bet or a raise, it is important to think about what your 
opponent thinks you're going to do. An opponent who is sure 
you're going to call will not be bluffing when he bets or raises.
A corollary to this principle is if your opponent bets when 
there appears to be a good chance you will fold, that opponent 
may very well be bluffing. What this means in practice is that if 
your opponent bets in a situation where he thinks he might be able 
to get away with a bluff, you have to give more consideration to 
calling him even with a mediocre hand.
Astute readers will have noticed that this principle and 
corollary are the bases of stopping and inducing bluffs, which 
were discussed in Chapter Twenty. When you show strength, 
especially more strength than you really have, to stop a bluff, you 
must be prepared to fold when your opponent bets into you 
because that opponent is expecting you to call; therefore he has a 
hand. Conversely, when you have shown more weakness than you 
really have, you must automatically call a player who bets on the 
end because you have induced a bluff: That player may be betting 
because he thinks you will fold.
11 These suggestions violate the precepts of Game Theory but 
they are valid for all but the wildest or toughest games.
The Psychology of Poker 241
Betting on the Basis of What 
Your Opponent Thinks
In deciding whether to bet, it is equally important to think 
about what your opponent thinks you have. If you know your 
opponent suspects you have a strong hand, you would tend to 
bluff more with a weak hand because the chances are good your 
opponent will fold. However, you should not bet a fair hand for 
value in this situation. Your opponent's fear of your strong hand 
will probably make him fold all the hands he might have except 
those which have you beat.
Conversely, if you know your opponent suspects you are 
weak, you should not try to bluff because you'll get caught, but 
you should bet your fair hands for value because he'll pay you off.
Psychology and 
Future Impressions
Varying  your  play  and  making  an  "incorrect"  play 
intentionally are also part of the psychology of poker because you 
are trying to affect the thinking of your opponents for future 
hands. To take a simple example, you might make three-of-a-kind 
on fourth street in seven-card stud with two of the cards showing 
and check your open pair on a slowplay. Assuming your 
opponents saw your hand in a showdown, if you make a similar 
three-of-a-kind later in the session, you might bet it then. Since 
you checked three-of-a-kind before, your opponents are now 
likely to think you do not have three-of-a-kind, but something like 
two small pair or one pair and a three-flush. In other words, you 
are taking advantage of the impression you created earlier to get 
paid off later when you bet.
By the same token, let's say you make an open pair on fourth 
street, but this time that's all you have. You check. Now your 
opponents will be suspicious that you may have three-of-a-kind.
242 Chapter Twenty-three
They may give you a free card, and if one of them bets, you can 
be fairly certain that player has a good hand.
In general, you should evaluate any play you make on its 
merits alone — that is, on its expectation in a given situation. 
However, as we suggested in the chapter on bluffing, you might 
occasionally want to do something that is theoretically incorrect, 
especially in a no-limit game. You might either bluff a hand when 
you are almost sure you won't get away with it or fold a 
legitimate hand when you think you are getting bluffed and then 
show the hand. What you are trying to do is create an impression 
for the future. You are making a bad play so that it sticks in 
everybody's mind. Once you have opponents thinking one way, 
you take advantage of that thinking later. These types of plays will 
work against players who are good enough to try to take 
advantage of their new-found knowledge but who are not good 
enough to realize that you know they are going to try to take 
advantage of it and that they should therefore ignore it. Once 
again it comes down to knowing your opponents. You have to 
know how they think and whether they are capable of thinking on 
the level you are giving them credit for. If they think on a still 
higher level, you have to step up to that level too.
Summary
The psychology of poker is an important aspect of the game. 
You should think not only about what your opponents have, but 
about what they think you have and about what they think you 
think they have. You must go through such thought processes 
against good players in particular, but the better they are, the more 
difficult it is to figure them out. When you get to the expert level, 
the process sometimes becomes so complex and tenuous that you 
have to fall back on game theory.
On the other hand, these thought processes can be costly 
against weak players — as we saw in Chapter Eight — because 
your opponents are not thinking on such an advanced level.
The Psychology of Poker 243
Against weak players the best strategy is to play your cards in a 
basic, straightforward way.
Thinking about what your opponent is thinking will improve 
your calling and betting strategy. If an opponent is sure you will 
call his bet, he is not bluffing; if he thinks you will fold, he may 
be bluffing. By the same token, if an opponent thinks you are 
strong, you may be able to bluff, but you should not bet a fair 
hand for value. If an opponent thinks you are weak, you can't 
bluff, but you can bet your fair hands for value.
Ordinarily you evaluate a poker play solely on its own merits, 
but you can occasionally make a bad play for psychological effect 
— to create an impression for the future.
The psychology of poker is an extension of reading hands and 
using deception in the play of your own hands, and thus it is an 
extension of the Fundamental Theorem of Poker.

Analysis at the Table
Like any other gambling game, poker is a game of risks 
versus rewards. Any decision you make at the poker table can be 
thought of as a comparison of the risk involved in a particular play 
and the possible reward for the play. There are three questions 
involved in arriving at a decision: How great is the risk? How 
great is the reward? Is the reward great enough to justify the risk?
When deciding whether to bluff, your risk is a bet. Your 
reward is the pot (as well as advertising value if you show the 
bluff). When deciding whether to bet a mediocre hand before all 
the cards are out, you risk a bet. If successful, your reward (when 
your opponent doesn't simply fold) is that you didn't give a lesser 
hand a free card to outdraw you. When you check a big hand, you 
risk losing a bet on that round as well as losing the pot to a hand 
that would have folded if you bet. Your reward is a check-raise or 
future bets on later rounds. When deciding whether to call, your 
risk is a bet, and your reward is the pot. Any poker decision can 
be put into these terms. What do you have to gain (including 
future benefits on subsequent hands) by making a particular play? 
What do you have to lose? The ability to evaluate properly the 
risk-reward ratio for any poker decision is the ultimate test on the 
road to becoming a champion poker player.
The trouble is that unlike chess and many other games, poker 
is a game of speed. Every once in a while you are allowed to think 
about a hand, but in general you have to make decisions in a few 
seconds. You can't sit there for two minutes calculating odds, 
trying to read your opponents' hands, trying to figure out what 
they are thinking, and then deciding upon your best play. For one 
thing the other players at the table wouldn't tolerate your 
dawdling. For another, you would be giving away information 
about your hand, since any time you paused unduly long to
245
246 Chapter Twenty-four
reflect, your opponents would know you had some kind of 
problem. (Consequently, when you find, despite your best efforts, 
you have to pause often when you're playing, you should also 
pause when you have no reason, to throw your opponents off.)
Poker tends to be a game for quick-thinking people. Some 
geniuses are plodding thinkers, unable to come to quick decisions, 
and they can never become great poker players. On the other 
hand, some of the best poker players in the world are not super 
minds, but they are super-quick minds and can remember any 
mistake they and their opponents make. Some combination of 
quick thinking and instant recall has to be developed if you want 
to become a poker champion.
Analysis in Theory
One of the most difficult things for the average poker player 
to do is to make accurate decisions at the game in the heat of a 
hand. Many good and bad players alike simply decide what they 
think their opponent has and then go on to determine their best 
play on the assumption that their opponent has the hand they're 
assuming he has. However, as we saw in the chapter on reading 
hands, this is a bad and potentially costly way of going about the 
business of decision-making. There is a better way, which is 
employed by most good players. They ask, "What are the various 
hands my opponent could have, and what are the chances he has 
each of them?" They determine the best play for each of the 
possible hands, and they usually choose the best play against their 
opponent's most likely hand or hands.
Sometimes it works out that no matter what your opponent 
has, you wind up with the same best play. This is especially true 
in the relatively easy decisions — for example, deciding to fold 
when you have nothing in seven-card stud, the pot is small, and 
your opponent with an open pair of aces bets on the end.
If, on the other hand, the pot were large — hence the reward 
would be large — you might want to determine the chances of a 
bluff raise working if your opponent has nothing but two aces.
Analysis at the Table 247
And, of course, those chances depend upon the chances that your 
opponent has in fact only aces.
Frequently, then, a different play becomes correct depending 
upon what your opponent has. For example, a bluff raise might 
have a reasonable chance of working if your opponent has nothing 
but two aces. It has less chance of working if that opponent has 
aces up. It has little to no chance of working if he's made a 
straight and no chance whatsoever against aces full. Therefore, 
determining whether the risk of two bets (calling and raising) is 
worth the possible reward of the pot depends:
1.Upon the chances that your opponent has only two aces
rather than any of his other possible hands.
2.On whether that opponent is the type of player who would
fold them if you raise.
Let's say you decide there's only about a 25 percent chance that 
your opponent has two aces and a 75 percent chance he has aces 
up or better. Furthermore, if that player does have only aces, you 
think there's only about a 50 percent chance he will fold if you 
raise. Then the reward of the pot is probably not worth the risk of 
two bets, and you should fold. In general, when you have alternate 
plays dependent upon your opponent's hand, you choose the best 
play against his most likely hand or hands.
Let's say you figure an opponent to have Hand A 40 percent 
of the time, Hand В 35 percent of the time, and Hand С 25 percent 
of the time. Usually you would pick the best play against Hand A, 
which is your opponent's most likely hand. However, if Hand A 
requires one play, while both Hand В and Hand С require quite 
another play, you would ordinarily make the second play since it 
would be right 60 percent of the time — 35 percent of the time 
when your opponent has Hand В and 25 percent of the time when 
he has Hand C.
When analyzing a poker situation, you go through four steps 
in deciding on your best play.
1 .  Determine the possible hands your opponent may have. 2. 
Assess the chances of his having each of his possible hands.
248 Chapter Twenty-four
1.Determine your best play against each of his possible hands.
2.In most cases, pick the play that will most often be correct.
Analysis in Practice
To see how this sort of analysis works in practice, we'll look 
at a couple of examples.
Draw Poker
$5-$ 10 Limit
Opponent
You open for $5 in early position. Everyone folds except the 
player under the gun who originally checked to you and who now 
raises another $5. We'll assume you know this player will never 
make such a play without three-of-a-kind or better. We'll also 
assume that with the antes and your implied odds it would be 
incorrect to fold even if you knew your opponent had a pat hand. 
So the question is whether you should simply call the $5 raise or 
reraise another $5.
Analysis at the Table 249
Your opponent's raise tells you he has either trips, which 
must necessarily be smaller than your three aces, or a pat hand. If 
he has trips, you have the best hand and are the favorite to win the 
pot; if he has a pat hand, you have the second-best hand and are 
an underdog to win the pot. According to draw poker distribution, 
your opponent will have three-of-a-kind about 65 percent of the 
time and a pat hand about 35 percent of the time. When he has a 
pat hand, you should obviously not reraise. However, it's nearly 
2-to-l he has trips. Should you therefore reraise?
The answer is no because when you only call and your 
opponent draws cards, you can draw one card, as though you had 
two pair, and check-raise after the draw. Assuming he calls your 
raise, which he will almost always do, and neglecting the slight 
chance of your opponent improving to a full house when you 
don't, you win $30 (plus the antes) by playing this way — $10 
before the draw and  $20  afterward when you check, your 
opponent bets $10, and you raise to $20. In contrast, by reraising 
$5 before the draw and coming out betting $ 10 afterward, you win 
a total of $25 — $15 before the draw and $10 afterward. Thus, the 
65 percent of the time your opponent has three-of-a-kind, you win 
$5 more by calling instead of reraising. At the same time, the 35 
percent of the time he has a pat hand (and you don't improve to a 
full house), you lose only $10 instead of $15, a savings of $5. 
Therefore, in this situation a call is the correct play since it is right 
all the time — whether your opponent has three-of-a-kind or a pat 
hand.

250 Chapter Twenty-four
Here is a trickier situation from hold 'em:
Hold 'em
$10-$20 Limit (Small Pot)
Board
Your opponent, who is a good player, checked and called 
your bet on the flop. When the deuce falls, your opponent checks 
again. Should you check or bet your pair of kings?
In hold 'em, any time an opponent bets, calls, or raises, good 
players ask, "What could my opponent have done that with?" 
Then they think of the various hands the opponent might have to 
do what he did. So when your opponent called your bet on the 
flop and then checked on fourth street, you try to determine what 
hands he might have that prompted him to play the way he did.
Your opponent could be slowplaying a better hand than yours 
— say, K,9 or 6,6. You estimate there's a 25 percent chance he 
has such a hand. He might have a fairly good hand such as K, J or 
K,10. You figure those hands at 25 percent, too. Your opponent 
might have a mediocre hand like K,4 or A,9 or 10,10. The chances
Analysis at the Table 251
of those hands you put at 35 percent. And you figure there's a 15 
percent chance your opponent has 8,7 and is drawing to a straight.
You know that if you bet on fourth street after his check, your 
opponent will probably call with his fair hands, with a straight 
draw and at least call with his big hands. However this player will 
probably fold his mediocre hands because the pot is not big 
enough to justify calling with them. Therefore, after your 
opponent checks on fourth street, it turns out the correct play may 
be to check it right back.12 Your intentions are to bet on the end if 
your opponent checks and call if he bets.
The rationale for this play is that, like many players, this 
opponent will fold his mediocre hands if you bet on fourth street 
to avoid having to call twice to see what you have. Your checking 
on fourth street makes it easier for him to call on the end, not only 
because you have made it cheaper but also because you have 
shown weakness. Obviously checking is also the better play that 
25 percent of the time you have the worse hand. Finally, checking 
on fourth street induces a bluff on the end.
The drawbacks to checking on fourth street are:
1.It gives your opponent a free card to outdraw you.
2.There's a 25 percent chance your opponent has a hand like
K,J or K,10, with which he would probably call twice.
It is important that the pot be small — say, under $60 in a 
$10-$20 game — to make checking right because you gain only 
one bet by checking and betting on the end into your opponent's 
mediocre hands, but you lose the whole pot if the free card gives 
your opponent the best hand.
Changes in the structure of hold 'em since this was first 
written has made this play debatable. However, the thinking 
process behind it remains valid.

Because you expect your opponent to fold his mediocre 
hands if you bet on fourth street, and you want to win at least one 
more bet from those hands, the correct play 60 percent of the time 
is to check. It is correct to bet only 40 percent of the time. You 
usually pick the play that is likely to be right most of the time: 
Therefore, you check.
Analyzing the Cost of a Mistake
Unfortunately, the play that is likely to be right most of the 
time is not always the correct play. When you have a choice of 
plays, you also have to decide how bad it will be if you make a 
mistake. Here is an obvious example. If your opponent bets on the 
end and you think the chances are better than 50-50 that that 
opponent has the best hand, the correct play most of the time is to 
fold and save a bet. However, it costs you not just one bet but the 
whole pot when folding turns out to be a mistake — that is, when 
you fold the best hand. Therefore, you would call, even though the 
chances are that you are making a mistake. The reason you call is 
that this mistake costs you only one bet, while the opposite 
mistake — folding when you have the best hand — costs you the 
whole pot. (This is simply another way of stating that you should 
call when the pot odds you are getting in relation to your chances 
of having the best hand make calling a play with positive 
expectation.)
Analysis at the Table 253
There are other situations, as well, where making the wrong 
play can cost you a considerable amount of money, so you should 
not necessarily choose that play though it is favored to be right 
over 50 percent of the time. Such situations come up particularly 
in no-limit poker. Suppose, for example, you have two queens in 
no-limit hold 'em, and you put in a small raise before the flop. 
Everyone folds except one player, who fires back with a gigantic 
reraise. You know that this player will make such a play not only 
with two aces and two kings but also with ace, king. Assuming 
you have nothing other than Bayes' Theorem available to put your 
opponent on one of these three hands, the odds work out to be 4-
to-3 in favor of your opponent's having ace, king rather than a 
pair of aces or a pair of kings. Thus, 4/7 of the time your pair of 
queens is the favorite, and 3/7 of the time it is the underdog. 
However, when your opponent does have ace, king, your queens 
are only a 13-to-10 favorite since there are five cards to come, any 
one of which could give your opponent either a pair of kings or a 
pair of aces. So while you will average winning 13 times, the 
other 10 out of 23 times you will lose the hand when you call the 
raise and your opponent has ace, king. On the other hand, those 
three times out of seven when your opponent has two aces or two 
kings, your two queens are a big 41/2-to-l underdog, meaning in 
those instances you will lose 18 hands out of every 22 you play on 
average.
Therefore, you cannot say, "My queens are 4-to-3 favorites 
to be the best hand. So I must call." It works out that the 3/7 of the 
time your opponent has two aces or two kings, you hurt yourself 
so much that you don't gain it back the 4/7 of the time when he has 
ace, king.
The general principle operating here is the following: When 
one alternative will have slightly bad consequences if it's wrong 
and another second alternative will have terrible consequences if 
it's wrong, you may be right to choose the first alternative even 
when the second is slightly favored to be the correct play.

Here is an example of the same principle in a limit game, 
where the consequences of making the wrong play are not nearly 
so severe as in the no-limit example:
Seven-Card Razz
$15-$30 Limit
Analysis at the Table 255
when your opponent does have an 8,7 made and reraises, you still 
have a good chance of outdrawing him. However, when he has 
paired, he has only a slim chance of beating you since your 9 low 
is already the best hand and you have an excellent chance of 
improving to beat your opponent — even if he makes his 8,7. In 
the long run then, you do better by raising than by calling though 
raising will be right only 45 percent of the time.
SUMMARY
Accurately and quickly analyzing risk-reward decisions at the 
poker table in the heat of a hand comes only with experience. 
Some top players do it intuitively. In this chapter we have 
presented the theoretical basis for these decisions. Most of the 
time, when the choice of plays is problematic, your best play is 
the one likely to be correct more than 50 percent of the time. 
However, when the favored play has very bad consequences when 
it is wrong, and the less-favored play has only slightly bad 
consequences when it is wrong, it may be correct to choose the 
less favored play.
OPPONENT
Your opponent bets $30, and you know this opponent will bet 
anything in this spot except two pair. Should you call or raise?
Probability tells us your opponent is a slight favorite — about 
55 percent — to have his 8,7 low made when he bets, assuming he 
started with three small cards. When he does have an 8,7 low, you 
should not raise since you are a slight underdog and will probably 
get reraised. However, when one of your opponent's upcards has 
paired one of his hole cards the remaining 45 percent of the time, 
a raise is very profitable since you are a big favorite. Thus, a call 
is correct 55 percent of the time, and a raise is the better play 45 
percent of the time. Nevertheless, the best play is to raise because 
raising will be slightly wrong 55 percent of the time, but calling 
will be very wrong 45 percent of the time. In other words, even

Chapter Twenty-five  
Evaluating the Game
Before sitting down, good poker players stop and evaluate the 
game, especially when they have many games to choose from as 
they do in Las Vegas, California, or New Jersey. However, a 
serious player should evaluate even a weekly private game before 
deciding whether to become a regular.
There are two reasons for evaluating a game. One is to 
determine whether the game is worth playing. The second is to 
determine how to play in that particular game. When professional 
players consider whether a game is worth playing, they estimate 
their expected hourly rate and decide whether that rate is 
satisfactory.
Social players in a home game are not generally so concerned 
with hourly rate. However, even they do not want to become 
regulars in a game where they have much the worst of it; nor do 
they want to get involved in a game whose stakes are either too 
high for their financial position or too low to be interesting. 
Additionally, social players should consider the game  —  or 
games, if it's dealer's choice — that are played and be sure 
they're comfortable with them. They should also consider the 
speed of the game. If they're really interested in playing cards, 
they probably do not want to become involved in a game in which 
there's a new deal only about every four or five minutes.
To determine whether a game is worth playing and how to 
play in a particular game, the two most important considerations 
are the structure of the game and the players in the game.
257
258 Chapter Twenty-five
Evaluating the Structure and 
Adjusting to It
By the structure of the game, we mean principally the ante, 
the betting limits, and the rules of betting. The structure may deter 
an average or even an above-average player from sitting down, 
but it should rarely deter a good player. The good player should 
be able to adjust his play to suit any structure he happens to 
confront.
There is however one instance where the structure might 
cause even a very good player to stay out of a game: When it has 
made fair players into good players by accident. Most players 
don't sufficiently alter their style of play according to the 
structure; they tend to play a fairly consistent game. However, 
sometimes the structure is exactly suited to the style of a group of 
players.  Specifically  the  ante  and/or  the  blind  might  by 
coincidence be an amount that makes these players' style of play 
approximately  correct.  For  instance,  there  are  some  very 
aggressive seven-card stud players in Las Vegas who play a little 
bit too loose in an ordinary game, but in a game with a very high 
ante, their style of play is almost perfect.
The Ante and Other Forced Bets
The key question to ask about the ante and other forced bets 
like the blinds in hold 'em is: How big are they in relation to the 
betting limits? As we saw in Chapter Four, when the ante is large, 
you must loosen up, try to steal more antes, and almost never 
slowplay. When the ante is small, you tighten up, steal fewer 
antes, and slowplay more. If you find you do better and are more 
comfortable in a tighter, small-ante game, that's what you should 
look for, and vice versa. For example, if you are especially good 
at disguising your hand, at slow laying, and at trapping opponents, 
then a small-ante game suits your style. If on the other hand you 
are an aggressive player with a keen sense of when to bluff and
Evaluating the Game 259
hen not to, a large-ante game is likely to produce the best 
results. However, whatever your style of play, you should avoid 
a game where the ante is simply enormous in relation to the 
betting limits. In that case, the pot is so large to begin with that 
it's worth calling with almost anything, and the game may almost 
be reduced to dealing out the cards and seeing who has the best
hand.
An important aspect of the ante structure is the size of the
initial bet and the size of the initial raise after the initial bet. 
Changes in these two bets can mean significant changes in 
strategy. To illustrate, we will use the standard $ 15-$30 razz game 
in Las Vegas and a $15-$30 razz game I've played in Reno.
Usually, a $15-$30 Las Vegas razz game has a $1 ante, and 
the high card has a forced bet of $5. Anyone can then raise $10 to 
make it $15. With this structure, it is almost always correct when 
you have a good hand to raise with the next-to-last low card if 
everyone else has folded. If you just call the $5 forced bet with a 
decent hand, the last low card is correct in calling behind you, 
even with nothing at all, simply because that player is getting 
about 31/2-to-1 odds on his $5 and figures to win if he catches a 
baby and you don't. However, by raising in this spot, you cut 
down the last low card's odds to about 2-to-l. Now if that player 
wants to take the chance of outdrawing you on the next round, he 
is taking the worst of it unless he has a good hand himself.
In the Reno $15-$30 game, on the other hand, the high card 
brings it in for $10, and then anyone can raise and make it $25. 
That structure dictates a completely different strategy in the 
situation just described. Under these circumstances it becomes 
almost always correct to simply call the initial $10 bet with the 
next-to-last low card when you have a hand. You are hoping for 
an overcall behind you since the player is no longer getting 
sufficient pot odds to gamble on outdrawing you.
The difference in strategy is based on the Fundamental 
Theorem of Poker. By calling, you have not only induced your 
opponent to make a mistake with a weak hand, but you've given
260 Chapter Twenty-five
the impression that your hand is weaker than it is. If your 
opponent calls, you welcome it. If he raises, that's fine too.
The interworking of different structures and strategies can 
also be seen by comparing the old $10-$20 hold 'em game in 
Reno and the $10-$20 hold 'em game in Las Vegas. In Vegas the 
first bet is $5, and a raiser can make it $10. In Reno the first bet 
is $4, and the raiser can make it $14. The first effect of these 
differences is to make you play somewhat tighter in Vegas since 
your initial investment is a dollar more. However, in Reno you 
must have a somewhat better hand to raise since you are investing a 
total of $ 14 — $4 more than a raiser in Vegas invests — and the 
initial pot that you are raising is smaller. That is, the ratio of the 
raiser's money to the first bettor's money is $14-to-$4 as opposed 
to $10-to-$5 in Las Vegas. Thus, in Las Vegas it is frequently 
correct to throw in a $5 raise to deceive your opponents and get 
them to check to you on the flop; but in Reno it is usually too 
expensive to raise simply for deception. Additionally, when you 
call the initial $5 bet in Vegas, you are almost always committed 
to come in for a second $5. However, in Reno you may very well 
have a hand that is worth a $4 call but should be thrown away 
before calling $10 more.
The Betting Limits
The first thing to consider about the betting limits is whether 
you can afford them. Even if you think you have much the best of 
it, you should not play in a game whose limits are so high in 
relation to your bankroll that you cannot play your hands correctly 
because you don't want to risk going broke. At the same time, 
when you think you have the best of it, you should play at the 
highest limits you can afford whenever possible.
The excellent nohprofessional player Jay Heimowitz, from 
Monticello, New York, tells the story of how he started playing in 
a 25-50-cent poker game in the early 1960s. "I noticed I was 
winning about $20 a week, and that $20 a week was the difference 
between my wife Carol and I going out to dinner," Heimowitz
Evaluating the Game 261
"Then I got the brainstorm that if I played in a $ 1 limit 
game maybe I'd win $40 a week, and we could go out to dinner 
twice'"  Today  Heimowitz,  a  successful  Budweiser  beer 
distributor, plays no-limit hold 'em for tens of thousands of 
dollars against the very best hold 'em players in the world, but the 
point of his story is that, everything else being equal, when you 
have the best of it, the higher you play, the more you will average
winning.
Assuming you are playing at a limit that suits you, the 
important question is the ratio of bet sizes from early rounds to 
late rounds. If the betting limits increase drastically from the early 
rounds to the later rounds, you must play quite a bit differently 
than if the limits remain fairly steady. In mathematical terms, the 
greater the escalation of the limits, the higher your implied odds 
on early rounds. Thus, you tend to play looser early in games 
where you may win bigger bets later. When we say looser, we 
mean you take chances with hands that have some chance of 
improving to big hands. You do not play mediocre hands that can 
only improve to fairly good hands. In other words, if you cannot 
be reasonably sure that a hand will be the best hand, even if it 
improves, that hand is not playable. However, a hand like a high 
inside straight draw, which you would not play if the bets 
remained fairly steady, may be worth playing if you figure to win 
a big bet later on when you hit.
Of course, the games with the greatest escalation in limits 
from early to late rounds are pot-limit and no-limit. No-limit 
poker does not technically have an escalating limit since anyone 
may bet any amount right from the start, but usually the bets 
become increasingly larger as the hand progresses. Thus, as we 
saw in Chapter Seven, in pot-limit and no-limit games implied 
odds — not the odds a player is getting from the pot — often 
become the primary consideration in betting or calling a bet.
When a game has fairly steady betting limits  —  most 
commonly limits like $2-$4, $5-$ 10, $10-$20, which increase 
only two fold from the first round to the last — you must start off 
with a good   hand and throw away hands that require you to 
get
262 Chapter Twenty-five
lucky. You have to pay too high a price to stay in, in proportion 
to what you might win the few times you hit. It is especially 
important to get rid of such hands in games where there is a great 
deal of raising on the first round. Frequently you find people 
putting in two and three raises before the flop in limit hold 'em 
games. In games like these, it is important to play high pairs and 
high cards and to stay away from hands like
For those starting hands to be played profitably you need a game 
with low early betting and high later betting. That is, you need a 
game where it doesn't cost you much to draw to a big hand that 
can make you a lot of money in the later betting rounds.
The Betting Rules
Some of the questions you should ask before sitting down to 
play are: Is check-raising allowed? Is a flat bet imposed, or is 
there variable betting? In seven-card stud, does the low card bring 
it in or the high card? How many raises are allowed? Does the 
player who opens the pot have to bet first next round?
Whatever the rules, you should be thoroughly familiar with 
them before you sit down to play. Don't make the mistake a friend 
of mine made the first time he ever played draw poker in Gardena. 
He is the only man I know who made a royal flush but lost the 
hand. In Gardena you need jacks or better to open, and a joker is 
used as a bug. That is, the joker may be used with straights, 
flushes, and aces; it cannot be used to make a pair except with 
aces.
My friend N.S. bought into a $2-$4 draw poker game for $40, 
and the first hand he picked up was an ace-high straight:
Evaluating the Game 263
He was in third position behind the dealer. The man under the gun 
checked, the second man checked, and N.S. gleefully bet $2. 
Everyone behind him folded, but then bang! The man in first 
position raised,  and the man in second position reraised. 
Stupefied, N.S. called the double raise, and the first raiser called 
the reraise.
When it came time to draw cards, the first man stood pat. The 
second man stood pat. N.S. was smart enough to realize his 
straight was beat, if not by the man in first position, certainly by 
the man in second position. So he cleverly discarded the ace of 
clubs to draw to a straight flush in hearts — or any kind of flush, 
since with the joker he'd have an A,Q high.
Drawing to
N.S. actually had four cards that
would make the straight flush — the

When
he looked at the card he'd drawn, there it was — the king of 
hearts! He'd made a royal flush, the pure nuts of pure nuts.
The man in second position bet. N.S. raised. The man in first 
position called. The man in second position reraised. N.S. 
reraised. The man in first position eventually folded his jack-high 
flush, but the reraising continued until the entire $40 with which 
N.S. bought into the game was in the pot. The second player 
turned over a full house — kings full of 9s. With a broad smile 
N.S. revealed his royal flush.
He was about to gather in the pot when his opponent asked, 
"Where are your openers?"
"Openers?" N.S. said. "I had a straight."
"But you drew one card," said his opponent. "You don't have 
openers."
Remember that in Gardena card rooms you need jacks or 
better to open. The joker can be used only with aces, straights, and
264 Chapter Twenty-five
flushes. Since N.S. had thrown away his ace of clubs and had 
indeed drawn one card to make the royal, he had no proof 
whatsoever that he had opened with a legal opening hand. Of 
course, there's a posted rule in Gardena card rooms to cover such 
situations: "When splitting openers, player must declare same and 
protect split card by turning it face up under a chip." N.S. had not 
informed himself of this rule, his royal flush was declared dead, 
and the full house won the pot.
Beyond knowing the rules, it's important to use them to your 
advantage — as the man in Gardena with the full house certainly 
did.  However,  here  we're  not  talking  about  exploiting 
technicalities but rather adjusting your play to suit the rules of the 
game. Suppose, for example, the game does not allow check-
raising. Well, that rule takes away a very effective tool, which 
presumably you can use better than other players in the game. But 
it changes your playing strategy in that it gives more power to the 
player in last position. Therefore, when you are in last position, 
you must bet quite a lot more since you are no longer putting 
yourself in jeopardy of a check-raise. You would semi-bluff more 
on earlier rounds because the worst that could happen would be 
that you'd get called—not raised. Even in first position you must 
bet more often than you ordinarily would since you can't check-
raise. (However, against tough players it may be still better to 
check and call, rather than bet out with a very good hand in first 
position, because you may induce them to bet with a hand they 
would have folded if you had bet.)
Adjusting Properly to the Structure
The important thing is to adjust your play to the betting rules, 
the betting limits, and the ante structure with which you are 
confronted. This ability to adjust is one of your greatest edges 
against the good but nontheoretical player. It takes quite a while 
for the nontheoretical player to find instinctively the correct 
method of play in an unfamiliar structure. In the meantime, that 
player makes costly mistakes.
Evaluating the Game 265
For example, the $15-$30 hold 'em game that used to be 
played at the Golden Nugget in downtown Las Vegas attracted 
some of the toughest hold 'em players in the country. However, 
as good and as solid as they were, most of them didn't realize that 
the structure of this game, compared to that of the more common 
$10-$20 hold 'em games they knew, necessitated a change in
strategy.
In the $10-$20 games there is ordinarily a 50-cent ante and 
a  $5  blind. It costs  $5  to come in and another  $5  to raise. 
However, in the $ 15-$30 Golden Nugget game, there was no ante, 
but there were two blinds — $5 and $10. It cost $10 to come in, 
and to raise it cost another $15 for a total of $25. Thus, in this 
game it cost considerably more to come in, relative to the betting 
limits, than it did in the $10-$20 game — especially when there 
was a raise. When you call the $5 blind in the $10-$20 game, you 
are investing half of the $10 bet on the flop; but when you called 
the $10 blind in the Golden Nugget $15-$30 game, you were 
investing two-thirds of the $15 flop bet. When you raise (or call 
a raise) in the $10-$20, you are investing as much as the bet on 
the flop — namely, $10; but when you raised or called a raise in 
$15-$30, you were investing almost twice as much as the bet on 
the flop — $25. Additionally, when you call the $5 blind in early 
position in $10-$20, you risk being raised only the amount of the 
initial bet; but when you called the $10 blind in $15-$30 in early 
position, you risked being raised another $15 — one-and-a-half 
times the initial bet.
The effect of these structural changes in the $15-$30 game, 
which made it more expensive to come in, was that you had to 
play very tightly and play only hands that didn't depend on high 
implied odds. Hands like ace, king and big pairs went up in value,
while hands like 6,7  suited and baby pairs, which are playable in
$
10-$20, went down in value. These differences were so
significant that anyone who understood them and adjusted to them 
properly had an edge in the $15-$30 hold 'em over players who 
may have been great in $10-$20 but who insisted on playing the 
same way in the $15-$30 game.
266 Chapter Twenty-five
Evaluating the 
Players and Adjusting to Them
When you are deciding whether to play and how to play, the 
other players in a given game are much more significant than the 
structure. Rarely will the structure deter good players from sitting 
down, but if they look around the table and see nothing but top 
players, relative to their own abilities, they should probably find 
another game. There is an old and true adage in poker: If you look 
around and don't see a sucker in the game, you're it.
At the same time, everybody in the game does not have to be 
worse than you. For a game to be potentially profitable, all you 
need are one or two bad players or five or six mediocre players. 
However, if everyone in the game is as good as you or nearly as 
good, you may not be taking the worst of it, but you cannot expect 
your hourly rate to be very high.
Players Who Play Too Loose
Once you have decided that the caliber of your opponents 
allows you to sit down and play profitably, your next step is to 
evaluate their mistakes and see how you can best take advantage 
of those mistakes. The most common mistake players make is 
playing too many hands. In Las Vegas I frequently find this 
tendency to be the only weakness in some opponents. Everything 
else about their play is top-notch. Consequently, there is little I 
can actively do to take advantage of these players' mistakes other 
than not play as loosely as they do. Yet just playing better starting 
hands than they do on average is a decent edge. Sometimes I play 
a very unimaginative game against them, simply to make them 
think I'm not much of a player. I thereby encourage them to play 
even more hands. When the night is over, I usually have the 
money, and they are shaking their heads, wondering how I beat 
them. Well, I didn't outplay them, just as they suspect, nor did I 
get lucky. I simply played better openers than they did, and so
Evaluating the Game 267
hen I was in a pot against them, more often than not I ended up 
with a better hand than theirs.
Often players who play too many hands will make many 
other mistakes as well. A typical loose player will call too much, 
not just on the first round but on all rounds. These players are the 
kind you encounter most often in home games. They play poker 
only once a week, and they want action. Against such opponents, 
conservatism and patience pay big dividends. You play your solid 
cards, and you don't bluff nearly as much as game theory 
indicates to be correct. There is clearly no value in bluffing when 
you know you'll be called — except perhaps once or twice early 
in a session for advertising purposes, to make doubly sure you'll 
get called later with your legitimate hands.
Players Who Play Too Tight
Occasionally you'll run into the opposite type of player — 
the player who plays too tight. These players may play too tight 
on the first round or on every round, but the tighter they play, the 
more they are giving away. You take advantage of the player 
who's too tight on the first round by stealing antes with more 
frequency than game theory would indicate to be correct. In fact, 
you should test such a player by raising the forced bet just about 
every time you and he are the only players left in the pot. You 
shouldn't raise every single time the situation comes up, because 
eventually that tight player will realize you're robbing him and 
he'll loosen up, which you don't want him to do. However, you 
should try making a play on that player at least two times out of 
three when he is the only person left behind you on the first round.
Many players who play too tight on the opening round tend 
to play too loose later on. Since they're playing only good starting 
cards, they hate to throw them away. Consequently, if you get 
called by such a player when you try to steal the antes on the 
opening round, it is very important to give up your bluff because 
this type will not fold on later rounds, having called your raise. 
However, if you have a legitimate hand which you figure to be the
268 Chapter Twenty-five
best hand, bet it out since this player will probably give you 
crying calls all the way.
Much rarer are the tight players who throw away too many 
hands on all rounds. Against them, you should semi-bluff just 
about any time you're able to represent a good hand, and you 
should bluff more than game theory would indicate to be correct.
Other Mistakes to Look For
As we saw in the first section of this chapter, some otherwise 
excellent players are incapable of adjusting to different structures. 
Therefore, you may sometimes decide to sit down in a game with 
them specifically because you know they are playing on 
unfamiliar turf. You take advantage of their weakness by playing 
more correctly, according to the structure, than they do.
One of my favorite types of player is the one who never 
bluffs. You have a tremendous advantage over these players 
because you just about always know where you're at. Against 
most players you have to call with a marginal hand since you 
usually have two ways of winning — either by improving to the 
best hand or by having them beat when they're bluffing. However, 
you can assume that players who never bluff have hands when 
they bet, and you only call when your hand has a fair chance of 
beating theirs or when you're getting good enough pot odds to 
chase. You never need to consider calling on the chance that they 
may be bluffing. Even players who bluff much less frequently 
than they should offer you a big advantage, especially when you 
make plays to stop the few bluffs they might be tempted to try 
against you.
Over a period of time, you can save a tremendous number of 
bets by not having to call such players. At the same time, you are 
likely to make money from them since you only play against them 
with a legitimate hand that has a reasonable chance of beating 
theirs. Ironically, though, against such players you face the 
psychologically upsetting fact that you only profit from their 
mistakes when you fold and lose the pot to them. Your profit
Evaluating the Game 269
comes from having lost less to them than you would have lost to
players whose legitimate hands you might have paid off. This is
an example of the poker principle that any bet saved means more
money earned at the end of the session and at the end of the year.
Sometimes the only weakness I can discern in opponents is
that they will never check-raise bluff. Even this relatively small
flaw gives me an edge. Knowing that these opponents always
have good hands allows me to fold hands I might otherwise have
called with when I do get check-raised. Anytime I can do this I
save money, and these savings add up in the long run. Other
players will never make any kind of bluff raise; against them I can
save even more money since I always know they have good hands
when they raise.
Occasionally you encounter players who never check-raise. 
You take advantage of this major mistake by betting more hands 
after they check than you would against other players who have 
checked. Since these players don't check-raise, you know they are 
checking because they have only fair hands at best. You are 
actually in a better position than you would be when a hand is 
checked to you in a non-check-raising game, because in these 
games a player will occasionally check a good hand to induce you 
to bet a weaker hand. The players who never check-raise will 
hardly be so cute: When they check, it's because their hands are 
not worth betting.
Players who bluff much more than they should give you a 
tremendous opportunity for a profitable session. You should do 
everything you can to induce them to bluff even more and then 
call them. There is one player whom I run into now and then in 
Las Vegas who bluffs much too much. I never bet into that player 
because he will usually fold. Instead I check, and he will almost 
automatically bet; then, depending upon my hand, I either call or 
raise. It's true that by playing against him this way, I give him 
many chances for a free card, but that risk is more than 
compensated for by the times he just keeps on bluffing at the pot. 
(Though players who bluff too much can produce a profitable 
session for you, they are also much more dangerous than players
270 Chapter Twenty-five
who never bluff, especially if you are on any kind of limited 
bankroll. To take advantage of these players' mistakes, you must 
induce bluffs and nearly always call them, even when you have a 
mediocre hand. Obviously players who bluff too much get their 
share of good hands like the rest of us. When they get more than 
their share, you will tend to pay them off when you wouldn't pay 
off others. Therefore, up to a point, were I on a limited bankroll, 
I would prefer my opponents to be tight, nonbluffing players 
rather than wild, bluffing players.)
There are endless kinds of mistakes you can detect in your 
opponents' play, and when you detect them, there is always a way 
to take advantage of them. Following is a list of the most common 
mistakes poker players make, accompanied by the best strategies 
to use to take advantage of the mistakes.
Type of Mistake
1.Bluffs too much.
2.Bluffs too little.
2. Stop a bluff, then fold if 
you cannot beat a hand 
(unless there are more 
cards to come and you 
are getting good enough 
odds to chase).
fair 3. Never bluff, but be sure 
to come out betting with 
a decent hand.
4.  Don't  slowplay.  Bet 
your decent hands for 
value.
Type of Mistake
5.    Folds too often on the 
end.
6.  Plays very tight on the 
first  round,  but  then 
won't  throw  a  hand 
away
7.    Never check-raises.
8.    Never bluff raises.

on any round.
Evaluating the Game 271
Best Strategy
1.Bluff more than
you
normally   would,
but
don't   bet   your
fair
hands for value.
2.If this player has not
yet called and no one
else is left, try to steal
the   antes   no   matter
what you have. If the
player calls your raise,
give  up  on  a  bluff.
However, you can play
a  fair hand  for  one
card. If the next card
improves    you,    the
player still won't fold.
3.Bet many more hands
behind this player than
you    would    behind
someone   who    does
check-raise.
4.Fold fair-to-good hands
when this player raises.
Bet weaker hands than
normal into him since
his response will give
you more information
than you usually get.

9.  If you are first and have 
little, check to see what 
this player does. If he 
also checks, you can be 
pretty sure a bluff will 
work the next round.
1.Play solid poker, and
cut   down   on   your
bluffs.
2.Play solid cards, but
play    them    meekly.
Make this player think
he can run over you.
12.    Semi-bluffs too much.       12.    Semi-bluff raise.
13.  Play as many hands as 
possible  against  this 
type of player, just as 
you would if you were 
using marked cards.
Rules of Play
Five-Card Draw
After the ante each player is dealt five cards face down. 
Starting with the player to the dealer's left, each player checks, 
bets, or raises. To open, a player must usually hold a pair of jacks 
or better. In many games a joker is used, usually as a bug but 
sometimes as a wild card.
Once the first round of betting is complete, each active 
player, starting to the dealer's left, has the option of discarding 
from one to five cards and receiving replacements from the dealer. 
Sometimes the rules of a game restrict to three the number of 
cards any player may replace.
After the draw, there is a final round of betting, usually 
starting with the player who opened the pot. In the showdown the 
best high hand wins.
Seven-Card Stud
Three cards are dealt to each player, two face down and one 
face up. Depending on the betting rules, either the low card or the 
high card on board starts the action. When there are two low (or 
high) cards of the same rank, either the card of the lowest ranking 
suit (clubs, then diamonds, then hearts) or the card closest to the 
dealer's left starts the action, once again depending on the betting 
rules in effect.
After the first round of betting, a fourth card is dealt face up,
and now the high hand on board starts a second round of betting. 
(If there are two identical high hands, the one closest to the 
dealer's left begins.)
273
10.    Plays too loose.
Type of Mistake 
9.    Never slowplays.
11. Plays too loose on early 
rounds  and  too 
aggressively later on.
13.  Plays weakly and in a 
way that gives away his 
hand.
274 Appendix A
A fifth and then a sixth card are dealt face up with a round of 
betting after each. A seventh card is dealt face down, followed by 
a final round of betting. In each case the high hand on board starts 
the action. In the showdown the best high hand wins.
Hold 'em
Hold 'em is most easily described as a variation of 
seven-card stud. Two cards are dealt face down to each player, 
and then a total of five community cards are dealt face up in the 
center of the table. Each player uses the five community cards in 
combination with his hole cards to form the best five-card hand.
After the first two cards are dealt to each player, there is a 
round of betting, beginning with a forced, blind bet by one, two, 
and sometimes three players to the immediate left of the dealer or 
the button if there is a house dealer. In limit hold 'em there is 
usually only one forced blind.
After that first round of betting, the dealer turns over three 
cards, called the flop, in the center of the table. These are the first 
three community cards. Thus, if the flop is
a player
holding
in the hole has two pair; a player holding
in
the hole has a four-flush and an open-ended straight; and a player 
holding
in the hole has three 8s.
Following the flop, there is a round of betting, followed by a 
fourth community card, then another round of betting, then a fifth 
and final community card and a final round of betting. Each round 
of betting begins with the first active player to the left of the 
dealer or button. In the showdown the best high hand wins.
Five-Card Stud
Two cards are dealt to each player, one face down and the 
other face up. There is a round of betting, starting either with the 
lowest card or the highest card on board, depending on the betting 
rules. A third card is dealt face up, and there is a round of betting,
Rules of Play 275
tarring with the best high hand on board. A fourth and fifth card 
dealt face up with a round of betting after each. After the final 
round of betting, the best high hand in the showdown wins the 
pot.
Draw Lowball
In standard lowball (also called California lowball) the best 
low hand is A,2,3,4,5, followed by A,2,3,4,6; then A,2,3,5,6; etc. 
Frequently the joker is used as a wild card. In deuce-to-seven 
lowball the best low hand is 2,3,4,5,7.
Each player receives five cards face down. There is a round 
of betting, starting with the player to the dealer's left. Ordinarily 
the rules require that the player to the dealer's left bet blind.
After that betting round, players may draw up to five cards. 
Following the draw, there is a final round of betting. Usually the 
rules of play require a 7 low or better to bet in order to win any 
money put into the pot after the draw.
The lowest ranking hand in the showdown wins the pot. In 
standard lowball, straights and flushes are ignored. However, in 
deuce-to-seven lowball they count and therefore are not 
considered a low hand. In standard lowball the ace is a low card; 
in deuce-to-seven it is a high card. Another lowball variation 
makes A,2,3,4,6 the best low hand and counts straights and 
flushes as high hands.
When I discuss lowball in this book, I am always referring to 
standard or California lowball.
Razz
Razz is seven-card stud lowball with A,2,3,4,5 the best hand. 
Straights and flushes are ignored.
Two cards are dealt face down and one face up to each 
Player. Usually the high card on board (excluding the ace, which 
counts as low) starts the action. A fourth card is dealt face up, and
276 Appendix A
there is a round of betting, beginning with the best two-card low 
on board. A fifth and sixth card are dealt face up with a round of 
betting after each, starting with the best low hand on board. A 
seventh and final card is dealt face down, followed by a final 
round of betting. In the showdown the best low hand wins.
High-Low Split
This name covers several popular forms of poker. The game 
may be five-card draw, five-card stud, or seven-card stud, and in 
the showdown the best low hand and the best high hand split the 
pot. Sometimes, however, the rules may require that players have 
to declare — either simultaneously or consecutively — whether 
they are going for high, for low, or for both.
In five-card high-low split games the best low hand is always 
A,2,3,4,5, as in draw lowball. In seven stud games the best low 
hand is sometimes A,2,3,4,6, with straights and flushes counted 
as high. Aces always count both as low cards and high cards. 
(Hence, two aces may be a low pair as well as a high pair.) In stud 
high-low split games, the high hand on board usually starts each 
betting round.
A variation of high-low split requires a player to have an 8 
low or better to qualify for low. If no one has an 8 low or better, 
the best high hand wins the whole pot.
